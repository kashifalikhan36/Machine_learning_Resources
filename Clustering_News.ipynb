The question as to whether the Roman canon is not older\\neven than that of De Sacramentis is discussed by\\nliturgiologists.  Mgr. Batiffol is of this opinion, but we, on\\nthe contrary, think that the former bears traces of closer\\ncomposition, of a more carefully guarded orthodoxy, and that\\nconsequently it is a text corrected from De Sacramentis. We\\nshall see, in studying the list of names in the Memento of the\\nliving and that of the dead, that Mgr. Batiffol argues with good\\nreason that he can date these fragments from the pontificate of\\nSymmachus (498-514).

Gill\\n        graeme@labtam.oz.au\\n\\nDate: 93/5/16\\n\\n\\n\"What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?\"\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nAlthough it would be nice to think that \"an image is an image\",\\nthere are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of\\ndifferent image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole\\nlot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit\\ncomplicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you\\'ve ever downloaded\\nimages from BBS or the net, you\\'ve probably noticed (with most image\\nviewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some\\nlook too light. \"Why is this ?\" you may ask. This, is gamma correction\\n(or the lack of it).\\n\\nWhy do we need gamma correction at all ?\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nGamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode\\nray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you\\nhave some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer\\nimage by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of\\nthe scene, then you have created a \"linear\" or un-gamma-corrected\\nimage. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate\\nthe image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding\\nand multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).\\nNow if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage\\nand feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn\\'t_ give you\\nan amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light\\ncoming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage\\nsomething like this:\\n\\nLight_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma\\n\\nSo if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image\\nwill look much too dark. To fix this up you have to \"gamma correct\"\\nthe image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT\\nwill do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get\\nwhat you want. So you have to do this to your image:\\n\\ngamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)\\n\\nFor most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.\\n\\nIf that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ?\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction.\\nAlso not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras\\nor video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images\\nalready have some gamma correction done to them, and you are \\nrarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images\\nwith a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets\\ncorrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those\\nimages with a program that doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then it will\\nlook vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is\\nnot exactly right for you particular CRT.\\n\\nWhose fault is all this ?\\n-----------------------\\n\\nIt is really three things. One is all those display programs\\nout there that don\\'t do gamma correction properly. Another is\\nthat most image formats don\\'t specify a standard gamma, or\\ndon\\'t have some way or recording what their gamma correction is.\\nThe third thing is that not many people understand what gamma\\ncorrection is all about, and create a lot of images with varying\\ngamma\\'s.\\n\\nAt least two file formats do the right thing.\\nThe Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording\\nthe gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression)\\nspecifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a\\nlinear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).\\n\\nSome image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility)\\nallow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you\\nare using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to\\nview. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and\\nutilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma\\nof an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction\\nyourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has,\\nand then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.\\n\\n[ Note that xv 2.21 doesn\\'t provide an easy way of modifying the\\ngamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the\\nappropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity\\nin the HSV controls doesn\\'t do the right thing, as it fails to\\ntake account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends\\nto give a tint to the image. ]\\n\\nHow can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ?\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg\\n(provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file\\ncontaining two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear\\nto the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using\\ndithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects\\nimages, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point\\nat which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half\\nway from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if\\nyou move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a\\nbit.)\\n\\nIf your viewer doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have\\na long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness\\nwill be above the center.\\n\\nIf your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction\\nfor a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the\\ngamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be\\naround 2.2 \\n\\n[with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the\\n-dispgamma flag, and once you\\'ve got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA\\nenvironment variable in your .profile]\\n\\nHow do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ?\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of\\ntrue color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of\\n1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma\\ncorrection. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images\\n(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected\\nto some degree or other.\\n\\nIf your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will\\nlook good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.\\n\\nIf your viewer doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then linear images will\\nlook too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.\\n\\nWhy Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne of the reason that many high quality formats (such as\\nVideo) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better\\nuse of the storage medium. This is because the human\\neye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction\\nhas a similar compression characteristic. This means images \\ncould make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),\\nif they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that\\nevery time you want to do any image processing you should\\nconvert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain\\nthe same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and\\nnone of the popular image formats can agree on a standard\\ngamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected\\nimages at the popular level.\\n\\nIf some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,\\nand if image manipulation software takes care to use\\nextra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,\\nthen gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.\\n\\n(I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a\\nstandard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the\\nhighest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).\\n\\n###########################################################################\\n\\n\\n' ------------> comp.graphics\n",

It almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.\\n     It  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called \\nFamilies USA.\\n      The  poll tells us that the majority of  Americans  believe \\nthat doctors make too much money.\\n     The  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for \\nphysicians.  Those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be \\nOK.\\n     How generous.  How sporting.  How stupid.\\n     Why is this poll stupid?   Because it is based on resentment \\nand envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign \\nand are still simmering.\\n     You could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that \\nearns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  Since the majority \\nof Americans don\\'t make those bucks,  they assume that those  who \\ndo are stealing it from them.\\n     Maybe  the Berlin Wall came down,  but don\\'t  kid  yourself.  \\nKarl Marx lives.\\n     It\\'s also stupid because it didn\\'t ask key  questions,  such \\nas:  Do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to \\nbecome a physician?\\n     If those polled said no,  they didn\\'t know, then they should \\nhave  been disqualified.   If they gave the wrong  answers,  they \\nshould have been dropped.   What good are their views on how much \\na doctor should earn if they don\\'t know what it takes to become a \\ndoctor?\\n     Or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  \"How \\nmuch  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent \\ngrades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order \\nto (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking \\ncourses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and \\nmaintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  years \\nof  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourth \\nyears in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and \\n(d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e) \\nput  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training, \\ndepending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  in \\ndebt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60 \\nhours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or \\nmore until they retire or fall over?\"\\n     As  you have probably guessed by now,  I  have  considerably \\nmore  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  Clinton  and \\nClinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have \\ncalled together to remake America\\'s health care.\\n     Based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  far \\nmore useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing, \\nsocial tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is \\nto health what Clinton\\'s first budget is to frugality.\\n     But propaganda works.   And,  as the stupid poll  indicates, \\nmany Americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the \\nmajor cause of high medical costs.\\n     Of  course doctors are well-compensated.   They  should  be.  \\nAmericans now live longer than ever.   But who is responsible for \\nour longevity--lawyers,  Congress, or the guy flipping burgers in \\na McDonald\\'s?\\n     And the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become \\na  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   TV-gaping   couch \\ncabbages.\\n     Ah,  that  is not something you heard President  Clinton  or \\nSuper  Spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   But \\ninstead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain, \\nthey might have been more honest if they had said:\\n     \"Let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest \\nproblems we have.   That problem is you, my fellow American. Yes, \\nyou,  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  you \\nguzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack; \\ngetting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the \\nmicrowave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into \\nthe  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot \\nvictims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease \\nwhile blaming the world for not finding an instant cure.\\n     \"You  and  your habits,  not the  doctors,  are  the  single \\nbiggest  health  problem in this country.   If  anything,  it  is \\namazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do.\\n     \"In fact,  I don\\'t understand how they can stand looking  at \\nyour blubbery bods all day.\\n     \"So as your president,  I call upon you to stop whining  and \\nstart living cleanly.   Now I must go get myself a triple cheesy-\\ngreasy with double fries.  Do as I say, not as I do.\"\\n     But  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid, \\nthere is another solution: Don\\'t use them.\\n     That\\'s right.   You don\\'t feel well?   Then try one of those \\nspine poppers,  needle twirlers, or have Rev. Bubba lay his hands \\nupon your head and declare you fit.\\n     Or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   You  have  chest \\npains?   Then sit in front of a mirror,  make a slit here, a slit \\nthere, and pop in a couple of valves.\\n     You\\'re  going to have a kid?   Why throw your money at  that \\noverpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house \\nthan  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  and \\nmalpractice insurance than you will ever earn)?\\n     Just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   Squat and do  it.  \\nAnd if it survives,  you can go to the library and find a book on \\nhow to give it its shots.\\n     By  the  way,  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much \\npollsters should earn?\\n\\n\\nRoyko  is  a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for  Tribune  Media \\nServices.\\n\\n____________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n--\\n**********************************************\\nVinay J.

You\\'re talking about a permanent commitment to a\\nkind of sexual relationship that they aren\\'t really sure they can live\\nwith.  There may be people for whom this is a possible solution, but I\\nwonder whether it\\'s entirely fair to the other partner.  I have a\\ncousin who was a victim of exactly this situation.

Results of their research\\nwill be reported in the May issue of the scientific journal,\\nRadiology.\\n   Using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\\ncalled magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a research team led\\nby Brian D. Ross, M.D., D. Phil., conducted a study on 21 elderly\\npatients who were believed to be suffering from some form of\\ndementia. The exams used standard MRI equipment fitted with special\\nsoftware developed at HMRI called Clinical Proton MRS.  Clinical\\nProton MRS is easily applied, giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses\\nin less than 30 minutes.  An automated version of Clinical Proton\\nMRS called Proton Brain Examination (PROBE) reduces the examination\\ntime yet further, providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10\\nminutes.  By comparison, the current \"standard of care\" in testing\\nfor Alzheimer\\'s disease calls for lengthy memory function and\\nneuropsychological tests, which can be very upsetting to the\\npatient, are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy.\\n   In addition to Alzheimer\\'s disease, the new Clinical Proton MRS\\nexam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias, including\\nAIDS-related dementia, Parkinson\\'s disease and Huntington\\'s\\ndisease.\\n   \"We\\'ve developed a simple test which can be administered quickly\\nand relatively inexpensively using existing MRI equipment fitted\\nwith either the MRS or PROBE software,\" said Dr. Ross, adding,\\n\"this will help physicians to diagnose Alzheimer\\'s earlier and\\nintervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease\\ncauses further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain.\"\\n   Dr. Ross and his HMRI team measured a family of chemicals in the\\nbrain known as inositols, and myo-inositol (MI) acted as a marker\\nin the study.  In comparison to healthy patients, those diagnosed\\nwith Alzheimer\\'s showed a 22 percent increase in MI, while their\\nlevel of another chemical called N-acetylaspartate (NAA) was\\nsignificantly lower, indicating a loss of brain-stimulating neurons\\nbelieved to be associated with the progression of the disease.\\n   Current drug therapy for Alzheimer\\'s disease is widely\\nconsidered to be inadequate.  This is attributable, Dr. Ross\\nbelieves, to the theory that Alzheimer\\'s is caused by an\\ninterruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to\\nthe nerve cells. This belief has been adhered to over the last 15\\nyears, and consequently, most drugs to treat Alzheimer\\'s were based\\non the changing receptors for acetylcholine.\\n   \"Physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate\\nAlzheimer\\'s from other dementias, to provide the patient and his or\\nher family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment\\nprotocols for the treatment of this disease.  For this reason, we\\nconsider this test a major advancement in medicine,\" said Bruce\\nMiller, M.D., a noted neurologist at Harbor-UCLA, MRS researcher\\nand a co-author of the study.\\n   Other members of the HMRI research team included Rex A. Moats,\\nPh.D., Truda Shonk, B.S., Thomas Ernst, Ph.D., and Suzanne Woolley,\\nR.N.  The PROBE software can be fitted on the approximately 1,200\\nGeneral Electric MRI units currently in use in the United States,\\nand will be configured for other manufacturers\\' MRI units soon.\\n   For interviews with Dr. Ross, advance copies of the Radiology\\nMay issue, and other information, please contact John Lockhart or\\nBelinda Gerber for HMRI at 310-444-7000 or 800-522-8877.\\n\\n   Q & A on Alzheimer\\'s Disease:\\n\\n   What is Alzheimer\\'s disease and how is it caused?\\n   Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) is an incurable degenerative disease of\\nthe brain first described in 1906 by the German neuropathologist\\nAlois Alzheimer.  As the disease progresses, it leads to loss of\\nmemory and mental functioning, followed by changes in personality,\\nloss of control of bodily functions, and, eventually, death.\\n   How many people does it affect?\\n   Alzheimer\\'s disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in\\nthe United States and is the fourth leading cause of death, taking\\napproximately 100,000 lives each year.  While Alzheimer\\'s\\ndebilitates its victims, it is equally devastating, both\\nemotionally and financially, for patients\\' families.  AD is the\\nmost common cause of dementia in adults.  Symptoms worsen every\\nyear, and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset.\\n   What are its signs and symptoms?\\n   Although the cause of AD is not known, two risk factors have\\nbeen identified: advanced age and genetic predisposition.  The risk\\nof developing AD is less than one percent before the age of 50\\nyars old, but increases steeply in each successive decade of life\\nto reach 30 percent by the age of 90.  In patients with familial\\nAD, immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of\\ndeveloping AD.  One of its first symptoms is severe \"forgetfulness\"\\ncaused by short-term memory loss.

The Babylonian divinity was also represented\\nvery frequently in Egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity\\n-i.e. as a child in his mother\\'s arems.  THis was the way in which Osiris, \\'the\\nson, the husband of his mother,\\' was often exhibited, and what we learn of this\\ngod, equally as in the case of Khonso, shows that in his original he was none\\nother than Nimrod.  It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was\\noriginally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother,\\nor wife of Osiris.  But what could have led to the union of a Masonic body with\\nthese Mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architecture, and had\\nthe god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in\\nperfecting the arts of fortification and building?  Now, if such were the case,\\nconsidering the relation in which, as we have already seen, Egypt stood to\\nBabylon, who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the\\nMasonic art?  The strong presumption is, that Nimrod must have been the man. \\nHe was the first that gained faim in this way.  As the child of the Babylonian\\ngoddess-mother, he was worshipped in the character of Ala mahozim, \\'The God of\\nFortification.\\'  Osiris, the child of the Egyptian Modonna, was equally\\ncelebrated as \\'the strong chief of the buildings.\\'  THis strong chief of the\\nbuildings was origninally worshipped in Egypt with every physicall\\ncharacteristic of Nimrod.  I have already noticed the fact that Nimrod, as the\\nson of Cush, was a negro.  Now, there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded by\\nPlutarch, that \\'Osiris was black\\'.......\"  Hislop\\n\\nIt was like a cold slap to my face, when my wifes uncle brought out his\\ncerimonial dress and it was leopard skin.  I mean real leopard skin.   He told\\nme that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin.  (The reason that he\\nstarted telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months\\nto live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in Christ and he immediately\\nrepented from \\'mysteries\\' of the lodge!)\\n\\nNimr-rod from Nimr, a \"leopard,\" and rada or rad \"To subdue.\"  It is a\\nuniversal principle in all idolatries, that the high priest wears the insignia\\nof the god he serves.  Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of\\nsome leopard.  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show, or\\nshould I say hide, this representation.  They, however, worshipped the \"spotted\\ncow\".\\n\\nI\\'ll stand by my statements.  Masonry is of the \"mystery\" religions that all\\nfind their source in Babylon, the great harlot. Sorry Peter,  I do not mean to\\nbe a \"cold slap to the face\" but there is to much evidence to the contrary that\\nMasonry doesn\\'t find its origins in Egypt.

You got me thinking now!\\n\\nThis is an interesting question in that recently there has been a \\nmove in society to classify previously \"socially unacceptable\" yet legal \\nactivities as OK.  In the past it seems to me there were always two \\ncoexisting methods of social control.\\n\\nFirst (and most explicit) is legal control.  That is the set of \\nactions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set \\nof punishments.\\n\\nSecondly (and somewhat more hidden) is social control.  These are \\nthe actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered \\nby legal control, are scrictly controled by social censure. Ideally (if \\nsocialization is working as it should) legal control is hardly ever needed \\nsince most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of \\nsocial censure.\\n\\nThe control manifests itself in day-to-day life as \"guilt\" and \\n\"morality\".  I\\'ve heard it said (and fully believe) that if it weren\\'t for \\nthe VAST majority of people policing themselves, legal control would be \\nabsolutely impossible.\\n\\nLately (last 50, 100 years?) however there has been a move to \\nattempt to dissengage the individual from societal control (ie. if it ain\\'t \\nillegal, then don\\'t pick on me).  I\\'m not saying this is wrong, merely \\nthat it is a byproduct of a society which has:\\n\\n\\t1) A high education level,\\n\\t2) A high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media,\\n\\t3) A high level of institutionalized individual rights, and\\n\\t4) A \"me\" oriented culture.\\n\\nI guess what I\\'m saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition, \\nhere in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can\\\\\\ncan\\'t allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness, yet we \\nare fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as \\nthose freedoms don\\'t impinge on another\\'s.\\n\\nIMHO society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here.  While we \\nappreciate and persue individual rights (these satisfy the old \\nterritoriality and dominance instincts), the removal of socialized, \\ninherent fears based on ignorance will result in the \\ncontinued destabilization of society.  \\n\\nI got no quick fix.  I have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this \\nmess.  I know I would never consent to the roll-back of personal freedoms \\nin order to \"stabilize\" society.  Yet I believe development of societies \\nfollow a Darwinian process which selects for stability.  Can we find a \\nsocial model which maximizes indiv. freed.\\'s yet is stable?  Perhaps it is \\npossible to live with a \"non-stable\" society?\\n\\nAnybody see a way out?  Comments?\\n\\nPS.  Therefore answer to question #3:  We don\\'t.

I would appreciate any comments about this and other\\n'new' technology for hearing aids.\\n\\nThe ReSound system was developed on the basis of some research at AT&T and\\nappears to take a different approach from other aids. It appears to me that\\na new 'programmable' aid like the Widex just uses a more flexible (and\\nprogrammable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of\\nthe spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help\\nout in 'noisy' situations.\\n\\nThe major difference in the ReSound approach is that it divides the\\nspectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable),\\napparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in\\nthe low frequencies, while the important consonant information\\n(unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. The two bands then are\\ntreated with different compression schemes which are programable. They have\\nalso developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call\\n'abnormal growth of loudness'.\\n\\nThis latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience, though I\\nthink the phrase is missleading. What appears to be the case is that as you\\nexceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss, the deficit\\nbecomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach\\nthe 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge.  This means\\nthat if you just boost all sound levels, you are overloading at the high\\nend for people with hearing losses. Hence what you want is progressively\\nless amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point.\\nYou want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially\\ndifferently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (specially\\nfor someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls\\noff a cliff).\\n\\nAids with simple compressors don't descriminate between energy in the low\\nand high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequency\\ninformation because of high volume of low frequency components.\\nParticularly impressive was the ReSound performance with whispered speech\\nand in simulated restaurant noise situations. \\n\\n-Rich Haller <rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu>   University of Oregon, Eugene, OR,\\nUSA\\n\" ------------> sci.med\n",

Furthermore, notes on an addition 600 readings are\\nincluded in aTCotGNT (the majority of these occur in Acts).\\n\\nIn particular in the introduction to the section on Acts Metzger writes:\\n   \"[An attempt was made] to set before the reader a more or less full\\n   report (with an English translation) of the several additions and\\n   other modifications that are attested by Western witnesses ...\\n   Since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the\\n   text-volume, care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the\\n   evidence that supports the divergent readings.\" (p 272).\\n\\n>I understand that one of the early codexes, Vaticanus and Siniaticus has\\n>this version of Acts.  It would be interesting to know what the\\n>differences are between the long and the short forms.\\n\\n6] Most of the copies of the text of Acts that we have (including the\\nones in Vaticanus and Siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter\\n(or Alexandrian) version.  The longer version to which you refer is\\nusually called the \"Western\" version and its main witness is the Codex\\nBezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).\\n\\n7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark\\'s edition\\n(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the\\ntext edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains\\n18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.\\n\\n8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations\\nin the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main\\ndifference seems to \"expansion\" of detail in the Western text (or, if\\nyou prefer \"contractions\" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems\\nto be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific\\ncases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.\\n\\n9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the\\nmore authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything\\napproaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents\\npurely the \"authentic\" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be\\nexamined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the\\nAlexandrian text is the \"better\" more often than not.\\n\\nN\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

It is more than 99 percent \\neffective.\\n\\n\"This drug presents another long-term, effective option for women to prevent \\npregnancy,\" said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, M.D. \"As an injectable, \\ngiven once every three months, Depo Provera eliminates problems related to \\nmissing a daily dose.\"\\n\\nDepo Provera is available in 150 mg. single dose vials from doctors and \\nclinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive \\nprotection. If a patient decides to become pregnant, she discontinues the \\ninjections.\\n\\nAs with any such products, FDA advises patients to discuss the benefits and \\nrisks of Depo Provera with their doctor or other health care professional \\nbefore making a decision to use it.\\n\\nDepo Provera\\'s effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive \\nstudies by the manufacturer, the World Health Organization and health agencies \\nin other countries.

[NASDAQ: REGN] have discovered that \\ncertain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can \\nprevent the degeneration of light-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. The \\ndegeneration of these cells, known as photoreceptors, is a major cause of \\nvisual impairment \\n     This research, published to in the December issue of the Proceedings of \\nthe National Academy of Science (PNAS), holds promise for people who may lose \\ntheir sight due to progressive retinal degeneration -- currently, no drug \\ntreatment for retinal degeneration exists. It is estimated that 2.5 million \\nAmericans have severe vision loss due to age-related macular degeneration and \\n100,000 Americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus, a hereditary disease \\nthat causes blindness. In addition, each year more than 15,000 people undergo \\nsurgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas. \\n     The research was funded in part by the RP (Retinitis Pigmentosa) \\nFoundation Fighting Blindness, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and the National Eye \\nInstitute. It was conducted by Drs. Matthew M. LaVail, Kazuhiko Unoki, Douglas \\nYasurnura, Michael T. Matthes and Roy H. Steinberg at UCSF, arld Dr. C;eorge \\nYancoooulos, Regeneron\\'s Vice President for Discovery. Regeneron holds an \\nexclusive license for this research from UCSF.\\n     In the research described in the PNAS , a light-damage model was used to \\nassess the survival-promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring \\nsubstances. Experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week. \\nEyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their \\nphotoreceptor cells -- the rods and cones of the retina -- after light \\nexposure. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Ciliary Neurotrophic \\nFactor (CNTF) were particularly effective in this model without causing \\nunwanted side effects; other factors such as Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) and \\nInsulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) were not effective in these experiments. \\n     Discussing the research, Dr. Jesse M. Cedarbaum, Regeneron\\'s Director of \\nClinical Research, said, \"BDNF\\'s ability to rescue neurons in the retina that \\nhave been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age-\\nrelated macular degeneration, one of the leading causes of vision impairment, \\nand for retinal detachment.

It is possible that BDNF \\ncould play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached \\nsurgically.\" \\n     \"Retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the \\nretina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. Vision decreases \\nto a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. It is our hope \\nthat research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression \\nand preserve useful vision throughout life,\" stated Jeanette S. Felix, Ph.D., \\nDirector of Science for the RP Foundation Fighting Blindness. \\n     In addition to the work described , Regeneron is developing BDNF in \\nconjunction with Aingen Inc. [NASDAQ:AMGN] as a possible treatment for \\nperipheral neuropathies associated with diabetes and cancer chemotherapy, \\nmotor neuron diseases, Parkinson\\'s disease, and Alzheimer\\'s disease.

These findings, according to \\ninvestigators at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, have \\nserious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing \\ncountries. \\n     \"This study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and \\nhave higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  It shows also the \\nimportance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body \\nweight, thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing \\ncountries and affluent nations as well,\" explains principal investigator Dr. \\nWilliam E. Connor, head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid \\nmetabolism at Oregon Health Sciences University. \\n     Over the past 25 years Dr. Connor and his team have characterized the \\nfood and nutrient intakes of the Tara humara Indians in Mexico, while \\nsimultaneously documenting various aspects of Tarahumara lipid metabolism.  \\nThese native Mexicans number approximately 50,000 and reside in the Sierra \\nMadre Occidental Mountains in the state of Chihuahua.  The Tarahumaras have \\ncoupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing.  Probably as a result, coronary \\nheart disease, which is so prevalent in Western industrialized nations, is \\nvirtually non existent in their culture.  Loosely translated, the name \\nTarahumara means \"fleet of foot,\" reflecting a tribal passion for betting on \\n\"kickball\" races, in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more \\nwhile kicking a machete-carved wooden ball.\\n     The typical Tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans, tortillas, \\nand pinole, a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water, \\ntogether with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables.  The Tara humaras \\nalso eat small amounts of game, fish, and eggs.  Their food contains \\napproximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69 \\npercent) is of vegetable origin.  Dietician Martha McMurry, a coinvestigator \\nin the study, describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while \\nlow in cholesterol and fat.\\n     The Tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg/ dL, \\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels of 72 mg/dl, and high-density \\nlipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg/dl.  All of those values \\nare in the good, low-risk range, according to the researchers.  Elevated \\ncholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 20\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\ndisease.  HDL-cholesterol is considered beneficial.  In previous studies the \\nTarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease, although \\nable to respond to high-cholesterol diets with elevations in total and LDL-\\ncholesterol. \\n     Clinical Research Center dietitian McMurry and coinvestigator Maria \\nTeresa Cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a Jesuit mission school \\nbuilding near a community hospital in the small village of Sisoguichi.  Food \\nwas weighed, cooked, and fed to the study participants under the \\ninvestigators\\' direct supervision, ensuring that subjects ate only food \\nstipulated by the research protocol.  Fasting blood was drawn twice weekly, \\nand plasma samples were frozen and shipped to Dr. Connors laboratory for \\ncholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein analyses.  Regular measurements \\nincluded participant body weight, height, and triceps skin fold thickness.  \\nThirteen Tarahumaras, five women and eight men, including one adolescent, were \\nfed their native diet for 1 week, followed by 5 weeks of an \"affluent\" diet. \\n     \"In this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 \\npercent of total calories.  This is the prototype of the holiday diet that \\nmany Americans consume a diet high in fat, sugar, and cholesterol, low in \\nfiber,\" elaborates Dr. Conners. Such dietary characteristics are reflected in \\nthe cholesterol-saturation index, or CSI, recently devised research dietitian \\nSonja Conner working with Dr. Connor.  \"The CSI is a single number that \\nincorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in \\nthe diet.  CSI indicates the diet\\'s potential to elevate the cholesterol \\nlevel, particularly the LDL,\" Dr. Connor explains.  The Tarahumaran diet \\naverages a very low CSI of 20; Dr. Connor\\'s \"affluent\" diet used in the study \\nranks a CSI of 149. \\n     The experimental design of this study reflects the importance of \\nestablishing baseline plasma lipid levels, typical of the native diet, before \\nexposing subjects to the experimental diet.  The standard curve relating \\ndietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off, or \\nplateau, for consumption of large amounts of fat.  Changes in dietary fat \\nand/or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels.  \"You \\nmust have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put \\ninto the experimental diet.  The Framingham study, for example, did not \\ndiscriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease \\nbecause the diet was already high in fat.  All subjects were already eating on \\na plateau,\" Dr. Connor says. \\n     After 5 weeks of consuming the \"affluent\" diet, the subjects\\' mean plasma \\ncholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent, primarily in the LDL \\nfraction, which rose 39 percent.  HDL-cholesterol increased by 31 per cent, \\nand LDL to HDL ratios changed therefore very little.  Plasma triglyceride \\nlevels increased by 18 percent, and subjects averaged an 8-pound gain in \\nweight.  According to Dr. Connor, lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon, \\nyielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 \\ndays. \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 21\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n     The increase in HDL carries broad dietary implications for industrialized \\nnations.  \"We think HDL-cholesterol increased because we increased the amount \\nof dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous Tarahumara metabolic \\nstudy.  In that study we saw no change in HDL levels after raising the dietary \\ncholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption.  \\nIn the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total \\ncalories.  We reached the conclusion in the Tarahumara study that HDL reflects \\nthe amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary \\ncholesterol.  HDL must increase to help metabolize the fat, and it increased \\nquite a bit in this study,\" Dr. Connor explains.\\n     Low HDL in the Tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of \\ncoronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of \\nfat or cholesterol.  HDL remains an important predictor to Americans because \\nof their usual high fat intake. \\n     Dr. Connor recommends a diet for Americans that contains less than 20 \\npercent of total calories as fat, less than 100 mg of cholesterol, and a CSI \\naround 20, varying in accordance with caloric needs.  Such a diet is low in \\nmeat and dairy fat, high in fiber.  Dr. Connor also comments on recent \\nsuggestions that Americans adopt a \"Mediterranean-style\" diet.  \"The original \\nMediterranean diet, in its pristine state, consisted of a very low intake of \\nfat and very few animal and dairy products.  We are already eating a lot of \\nmeat and dairy products.  Simply to continue that pattern while switching to \\nolive oil is not going to help the situation.\" \\n     The World Health Organization (WHO) is focusing much attention on the \\nemergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies \\nundergoing technological development.  Dr. Connor says that coronary heart \\ndisease starts with a given society\\'s elite, who typically eat a different \\ndiet than the average citizen.  \"If the pattern of afluence increases, the \\nentire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, \\nwhich places a termendous health care burden on a society.  WHO would like the \\ndeveloping countries to prevent coronary heart disease, so they can \\nconcentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public \\nhealth measures to improve general well-being, rather than paying for \\nunnecessary, expensive medical technology,\" Dr. Connors says.\\n     \"The overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move \\ntheir plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high-risk range within a \\nvery short time by an affluent, excessive diet.  The present rate of coronary \\nheart disease in the United States is 30 percent less than it was 20 years \\nago, so a lot has been accomplished.  We are changing rapidly,\" he concludes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 22\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n\\n\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n                             General Announcments\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n\\n        Publications for Health Professionals Available from NCI (1/93)\\n\\nUnless otherwise noted, the following materials are provided free of charge by \\ncalling the NCI\\'s Publication Ordering Service, 1-800-4-CANCER.

            "'From: REXLEX@fnal.gov\\nSubject: ARSENOKOITAI: Scroggs (#3)\\nOrganization: FNAL/AD/Net\\nLines: 199\\n\\n[cont. Dr. James DeYoung; #3]\\n\\nR. Scroggs\\n\\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\\n\\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell\\'s \"learned discussion\"\\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the \\'mistress\\' or who hires him on\\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\\naffirms (109).\\n     This is Scrogg\\'s interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \\nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\\n\\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\\nthe lists\" (104). \\n\\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\\nin today\\'s Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\\nrelevant to today\\'s debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\\n\\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\\n\\nD. Wright\\n\\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell\\'s\\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell\\'s treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \\nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell\\'s\\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\\n\\n     Wright also faults Boswell\\'s claims regarding linguistic features of the\\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\\ngender\" (132). \\n\\n     It is with Boswell\\'s treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \\nFor example, Aristides\\' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell\\'s discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \\n\\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\\n\\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\\n\\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\\n\\n     Wright next replies to Boswell\\'s contention that the term would not be\\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul\\'s letters or deliberately avoid citing\\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \\n\\n     Boswell\\'s treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright\\'s attention\\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom\\'s infrequent use of the term.  Wright\\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \\n\\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell\\'s limited\\nconclusion based on them.\\n\\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\\n\\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  \\n\\n[Next: the questioning of Wrights position by William Peterson.  After that, we\\nget into the \"good\" stuff of historical & linguistic studies.  THis will\\ninclude \"Symposium\" by Plato.  If there is any doubt as to the modern\\nunderstanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of\\nPaul, this will certainly clear things up.  Also we will review Paul\\'s use of\\nLev18-20 in the NT and how, as for him, 1) the Law was fulfilled, but not done\\naway with, 2) Lev 18-20 was the universal and the following chapters the\\ngeneral.  Those who put forth that the OT no longer holds true today in our\\nculture, should stick around for this one.]\\n___________________________\\n13 R. Scroggs, THe New Testament and Homosexuality (Phil: 1983) 86, 107-8. \\nIndependently we came to the same conclusion.  Apparently the connection is\\nmade in E.A. Sophocles, Greek Lexicon of the Roman & Byzantine Periods (from\\n146BC to AD 1100).\\n14   See discussion, 101-4.  He says the same thing about Paul\\'s language in\\nRom 1:26-27 (128).  But this is doubtful.  See the more cautious words of P.\\nZaas, \"I Cor 6.9ff: Was Homosexuality Condoned in the Corinthian Church? SBLASP\\n17 (1979):205-12.  He observes that the words moixai, malakoi, and arsenokoitai\\nwere part of Jewish anti-Gentile polemic.  Yet Paul\\'s wors at the end of the\\nvice list, \"and such were some of you,\" indicate that \"Paul is addressing real\\nor potential abuses of his ethical message, not citing primitive tradition by\\nrote\" (210).  Wright disputes Zaas\\' attempt to associate the term with idolatry\\n(147).\\n15  On Boswell\\'s treatment of Rom 1:26-7, the article by R.B. Hays, \"Relations\\nNatural and Unnatural\"  A Response to John Boswell\\'s Exegesis of Romans 1,\" JRE\\n14/1 (Spring 1986): 184-215, is an excellent critique.\\n16  D.F. Wright, \"Homosexuals or Prostitutes?  The Meaning of ARSENOKOITAI (I\\nCor 6:9, I Tim 1:10), VC 38 (1984):125-53.\\n17  In an unpublished paper, Henry Mendell, \"ARSENOKOITAI: Boswell on Paul,\"\\neffectively refutres Boswell\\'s claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai. \\nHe finds the meaning to be general, \"a male who has sex with a male\" (4-11).  \\n18  Wright\\'s endnotes (148-49) list additional sources in the church fathers.\\n19   We also have noticed the same tendency by Boswell to fail to cite all the\\nreferences to Sodom and sodomy in the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.  See  J.B.\\nDeYoung, \"A Critique of Prohomosexual Interpretations of the OT Apocrypha and\\nPseudepigrapha,\" BSac 146/588 (1990):437-53.\\n20   In light of the claim made by Boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai\\npoints to a meaning lacking homosexual significance, Wright asks pertinently\\n\"why neither Philo nor Josephus use  paidofthoria, nor Josephus paiderastia,\\nand why . . Clement did not use the latter and Chrysostom the former?\"  (152 n.\\n71)  In a more recent article, \"Homosexuality: The Relevance of the Bible,\" EvQ\\n61 (1989):291-300, Wright reiterates these same points.  Paul shows a\\n\"remarkable originality\" in extending the OT ethic to the church (300).\\n\\n \\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

Gullibility, \\nblind obedience to authority, lack of scepticism, and so on, are all more \\nreliable indicators.  And the really dangerous people - the sources of\\nfanaticism - are often none of these things.  They are cynical manipulators\\nof the gullible, who know precisely what they are doing.  Now, *some*\\nbrands of theism, and more precisely *some* theists, do tend to fanaticism,\\nI grant you.

A recent rough test\\nshowed a gently sloping loss to 10-20db down at 1000cps. Then it falls off\\na cliff to 70-80dbs down from 1500cps on.  This type of loss is difficult\\nto fit. I am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which\\nkeep me roughly functional, but leave a lot to be desired.\\n\\nRecently I had an opportunity to test the Widex Q8 behind the ear aids for\\nseveral weeks. These have four independent programs which are intended to\\nbe customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed. I\\nfound them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about\\nto go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of\\nanother programmable system called ReSound.\\n\\nUnfortunately I was only able to try the ReSound aids in their office for\\nabout 30 minutes and I couldn't compare them 'head to head' with the Widex.\\nNevertheless, it did appear to me that they were superior and I was\\nimpressed by what I was able to read about the theory behind them which I\\nwill give in a separate posting. They also carry the Widex aids and had one\\npatient (presumably wealthy) who decided to go ahead and get the ReSound\\neven though he had purchased the Widex only 6 months ago.\\n\\nThe problem is that the ReSound aids are about twice as expensive as the\\nWidex and other programmable aids. I could take a trip to Europe on the\\ndifference!  Being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money, I am\\nhaving a hard time persuading myself to go with the ReSounds. I would\\nappreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projections\\nabout when and if I might see improvements in technology that aren't quite\\nso expensive.\\n\\n-Rich Haller <rhaller@ns.uoregon.edu>   University of Oregon, Eugene, OR,\\nUSA\\n\" ------------> sci.med\n",

Being ruled by the\\nSpirit rather than the letter not only frees from legalism, it also\\nprotects us from sins that are against the Spirit.  The word is a\\ntwo edged sword that cuts both ways.  \\n\\nI think we must be careful before we totally throw out Leviticus.  \\nIf the Law is reflection of God\\'s character and true holy nature, then\\nthose who say that God endorses homosexuality run into a problem.  \\nIf homosexuality were \"natural\" (whatever that means) wholesome, \\nendorsed by God, and those who oppose sexual behavior are narrow-minded\\nbiggots, as some would have us believe, why is there a condemnation of\\nit in Leviticus.  This condemnation is in the midst of all the other\\nsex sin condemnations, and there is nothing in the text to say that this\\nlaw was limited to temple prostitution, and no good reason to believe that\\nthis was the case.  Furthermore, male homosexual sex was a death-penalty\\ncrime!  \\n\\nIs every sin elaborated on in the New Testament?  Take a look at\\nI Corinthians 5.  Paul said that one of the Corinthians had broken a\\nlaw not even heard of among the Gentiles, that one should have his father\\'s\\nwife.  There is a prohibition against having your father\\'s wife in \\nLeviticus.  No other new Testament verse clearly condemns it (besides\\nthis one.)  Notice that Paul did not say that the sin was in commiting\\nadultery, etc.- he spoke against having one\\'s father\\'s wife.  \\n\\nNotice also that this sexual condemnation in Leviticus is not mentioned\\nin the specific context of paganism either.  And there was no pagan \\ncoustom mentioned in I corinthians either.  As a matter of fact\\ntaking one\\'s father\\'s wife wasn\\'t even done among the Gentiles.  It was\\njust a plain blantant sin, whether worshipping idols was involved or\\nnot.\\n\\n>One commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds\\n>of questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality\\n>only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was\\n>wrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act\\n>\"straight\" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying\\n>to define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian\\n>ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the\\n>relationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul\\'s\\n>judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make\\n>judgements on these questions.\\n\\nOne of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument\\nis because Paul probably did face this and other problems.  Sin can\\nbe tough to over come, especially without supernatural power.  Is\\nhomosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin,\\nlike lusting after a married woman, or sleeping around with people of\\nthe opposite sex?  I doubt it, and even if it is, that is no excuse.\\nGod is greater than all of it. \\n\\nAnother reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernatural\\npower of God to intervene in this kind of situation.  How many \\npeople have been set free from sin by the power of God?  Sure there\\nmay be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and failed.\\nThat is a reflection on the people involved in the program, and not\\nGod\\'s willingness and ability to change a sinner.  Any program that\\nuses formulas may fail.  What people need is the power of God to\\nchange them, whether they are involved in homosexual sin, or any other\\nsin.\\n\\n>I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is\\n>not entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Paul\\'s\\n>tendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating\\n>holidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues\\n>to look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to\\n>avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging.\\n>For example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat\\n>meat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about\\n>which they had personal qualms. \\n\\nI don\\'t see how you come to that conclusion.  Paul\\'s dealings with\\npastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in order\\nto spare others- not to allow people to continue in sin because it\\nwas just too difficult.  Take the example of eating meat offered to idols.\\nPaul felt that there was nothing wrong, in an abstract sense, with\\neating the meat.  Yet he advised believers to sacrifice their liberty\\nto eat meat in order to spare others.  \\n\\nBut Paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just to\\ntough.  Paul wrote to \"make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts\\nthereof.\"  (Romans 13:14)  Then he goes in to a discourse on how we\\nshould sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of others.\\n\\nSuppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual acts.  \\nSince others consider it to be a sin, then using Paul\\'s approach\\non pastorial issues, those who would otherwise be homosexuals should \\nsacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to a\\nmember of the opposite sex.  Paul never offers a lesser sin (homosexual\\n\"marriage\") to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered \\na more damaging sin.\\n\\n>For another example, Paul obviously\\n>would have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances)\\n>remain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly\\n>would rather see them married than in a state where they might be\\n>tempted to fornication.\\n\\nYet marriage itself is not a sin.  marriage is holy in all- and something\\nthat God ordains, and Paul recognizes this.\\n\\n> Note that in the\\n>creation story work enters human life as a result of sin.  This\\n>doesn\\'t mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved.\\n\\nActually, Adam was put in the garden to tend to it before he fell.\\nAfter he fell he would have to toil over the ground.\\n\\n>The dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often\\n>fails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from\\n>psychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when\\n>attempts at living as a heterosexual fail.\\n\\nThat is why we are dependent totally on God- what a vunerable and glorious\\nposition to be it.  We all must be transformed by the renewing of our\\nminds- and that is the only way homosexuals can walk in freedom, just\\nlike anyone else.\\n\\n>but I can well imagine Paul\\n>preferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian\\n>relationships than promiscuity.

The concepts of \"right\"\\nand \"wrong\" (or \"correct/incorrect\" or \"true/false\") belong to the\\ndomain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no\\nsense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is\\nlegitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).\\n\\nLet me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives\\nof epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively.\\nOne can certainly ask if a percept is \"right\" (correct, true,\\nveridical) or \"wrong\" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little\\nsense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is\\nstrange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can\\ncertainly ask that question about motives.\\n\\nTherefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can\\'t be considered:\\nthey assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.\\n\\nNow the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with\\nthe first part (that the \"rightness\" of a moral position is a\\nmeaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that is\\nirrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that\\none cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make\\nvalue judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the \"correctness\"\\nof the position.\\n\\nSorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).

You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\\n>you can think of to do so.\\n\\nI can see you have a revulsion for bestiality that far exceeds my distaste for \\nhomosexuality.  Certainly if I spoke about homosexuality the way you speak of \\nbestiality, nobody would have any trouble labelling me a homophobe.  Let me ask \\nthis gently:  why are you so judgemental of other people\\'s sexual preferences?  \\nWhat happened to \"No doubt I am free to do anything\"?  I think you have a \\nserious double standard here.  When you describe a comparison between \\nhomosexuality and bestiality as \"slimey\" and \"sleazy\", you are making an \\nimplicit judgement that bestiality is perverted, sinful, disgusting, \\nunnatural--in short, all the things that society once thought about \\nhomosexuality.  Not all people share your view.  You claim not to know any \\nsincere zoophiles, but this does not mean that they do not exist.  They even \\nhave their own newsgroup:  alt.sex.bestiality.  Are you going to accuse them \\nall of being mere \"jokers\"?\\n\\nI notice you deleted the main point of my comment:  the fact that the only \\nBiblical condemnations of bestiality occur in connection with the Levitical \\nprohibitions against homosexuality.  While there are some New Testament \\npassages that can arguably be taken as condemning homosexuality, there are none \\nthat condemn bestiality.  One of your main points seems to be that Christian \\nhomosexuality is acceptable due to the lack of any \"clear\" New Testament \\nstatements against it; if this is a valid argument, then should not Christian \\nzoophilia be made that much more acceptable by the fact that the New Testament \\nmakes no reference, clear or unclear, to the subject at all?\\n\\nI am quite serious here.  If I am going to accept homosexuality as Biblically \\nacceptable on the basis of your arguments, then I am going to be fair and apply \\nthe same standards to everyone else\\'s declared sexual preferences as well.  If \\nthe arguments you make for homosexuality can be applied to other sexual \\npreferences as well, I\\'m going to apply them and see what comes up.  I\\'m not \\ntrying to \"torpedo a serious issue\" by using what you label \"a ridiculous \\njoke\".  I posted a question about how we should interpret Biblical guidelines \\nfor Christian sexuality, and I don\\'t think such a question is \"irrelevant\" in a \\ngroup called \"soc.religion.christian\".  The Bible discusses homosexuality and \\nbestiality together in the same context, and therefore I feel I have a good \\nprecedent for doing the same.\\n\\n>Jesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\\n>the central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\\n>love one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\\n>ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\\n>in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\\n\\nI don\\'t know whether it makes any difference, but for the record, this is not a \\nside issue for me.  I believe loving one another includes not encouraging \\npeople to defile themselves, therefore it is of high importance to determine \\nwhether God regards certain sexual acts as defiling.  I can read in the New \\nTestament that \"God has joined together\" heterosexual couples, and that the \\nmarriage bed is undefiled.  I can read in the Old Testament that homosexual \\nintercourse and bestiality defile a person whether or not that person is under \\nthe Law.  If gay Christians can validly put aside the Old Testament standards \\nof defilement, then I want to know so that I can fairly apply it to all the \\nsexual practices that defiled a person in the old days.  I don\\'t think it\\'s \\nright to take just bits and pieces of the Law and try and apply them to \\nChristians today, e.g. bestiality still defiles you but homosexuality doesn\\'t.  \\nThat was pretty much what you said earlier, right?  You used different \\nexamples, but I think you said essentially the same thing about it being wrong \\nto apply only certain parts of the Law to Christians. \\n\\n>Christians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\\n>corner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\\n>old verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\\n>even read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\\n>the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\\n>manage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\\n>emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\\n>taking the trouble to find out what it is.\\n\\nIt was not my intent to stir up such an emotional reaction.  I personally don\\'t \\nget all that upset discussing alternatives to the monogamous heterosexual \\norientation; I\\'m afraid I naively assumed that others would have a similar \\nattitude.  Please note that I have never intended to equate homosexuality with \\nchild abuse.  I have merely noted that, for all the lack of \"clear\" NT \\ncondemnation of homosexuality, there is an even greater lack of NT condemnation \\n(or even mention) of bestiality, a practice which a number of people (e.g. on \\nalt.sex.bestiality) consider to be their true sexual orientation.\\n\\n>Such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\\n>WHY, for God\\'s precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\\n>condemn people you don\\'t know and won\\'t even take the trouble to LISTEN\\n>to BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\\n>God forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\\n>condemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in\\n>insisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are\\n>SO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.\\n> \\n>Why, for God\\'s sake?\\n> [quote from John 3:17ff omitted for brevity]\\n\\nThis is an excellent question, and I pray that you will not treat it as a mere \\nrhetorical question, but will genuinely seek to discover and understand the \\nanswer.  I recommend you begin with a little introspection into why you \\nyourself have much the same attitude towards zoophilia.  Why do you find \\nbestiality so repugnant that you regard it as slanderous to even mention in \\nconnection with other alternative sexual orientations?  Why do you not apply \\nall the same verses about love and tolerance to zoophiles the way you apply \\nthem to homosexuals?\\n\\nIs it because you automatically experience a subjective feeling of revulsion at \\nthe thought?  A lot of people have the same experience at the thought of \\nhomosexual intercourse.  Is it because you regard the practice as socially \\nunacceptable?  A lot of people regard homosexuality as socially unacceptable.  \\nDo you feel that it violates the traditional Judeo-Christian standard of sexual \\nmorality?  Many people feel that homosexuality does.  Do you feel the Bible \\ncondemns it?  Many people think the Bible says more to condemn homosexuality \\nthan it does to condemn bestiality.  Why then do you think comparing bestiality \\nwith homosexuality is insulting to homosexuality?  If you can honestly answer \\nthis question, you will have come a long way towards understanding why many \\npeople feel the same way about homosexuality as you feel about bestiality.\\n\\nAlso please note that I am not in any sense condemning *people*.  I am merely \\npointing out that when I read the Bible I see certain sexual *practices* that \\nthe Bible appears to condemn, e.g. sex outside of marriage.  When I say I think \\nadultery and pre-marital sex are sinful, do you take that as me failing to love \\nmy neighbor?  When you treat bestiality as something disgusting and \\nunmentionable, are you disobeying \"repeated orders not to judge or condemn \\nothers\"?  When you say other Christians are guilty of sinning by condemning you \\nand judging you, are you by that accusation making yourself guilty of the same \\noffense?  Or are you and I both simply taking note about *practices* the Bible \\nbrands as sinful, and leaving the judgement of the *people* up to God?\\n\\n>For long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\\n>evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\\n>rejected.  Some of us despaired and took to courses that probably *do*\\n>show a sinful shunning of God\\'s light.

If you mean that Jesus \\nis the Truth, and that He accepts sinners, and does not reject them, then I \\nagree.  If we were not sinners, then we would not *need* a Savior.  Our \\nsalvation in Christ, however, does not mean that sin is now irrelevant for us, \\nand we can now do whatever we want.  Nor does Christ\\'s grace mean that those \\nwho refer to sin as \"sin\" are being judgemental or intolerant.  I am speaking \\nin general terms here, not specifically about homosexuality.  If the Bible \\ncalls something \"sin\", then it is not unreasonable for Christians to call it \\nsin too.\\n\\nAs applied to Christian homosexuality, I think the only definitive authority on \\nChristian sexuality is the Bible.  If you make a list of everything the Bible \\nsays on the subject of homosexual intercourse, I think you will find that every \\nverse on the list is negative and condemning at worst, and \"unclear\" at best.  \\nThe most pro-gay statement you could make about the list is that there is some \\ndispute about the New Testament verses which many people interpret as \\ncondemning homosexual intercourse.  That is, from a gay perspective, the most \\npositive thing you can say about the Bible\\'s treatment of homosexuality is that \\nsome verses fail to clearly condemn it.  That\\'s it.  Jesus declared all foods \\nclean, the council at Jerusalem declared that Gentiles were not required to \\nkeep the ritual Law, but nobody ever reclassified homosexual intercourse from \\nbeing an abomination deserving of death to being an accepted Christian \\npractice.  You have verses describing homosexual intercourse as an abomination \\nthat defiles both Jews under the Law and Gentiles not under the Law, and you \\nhave some verses which are at best \"not clear\" but which some people believe \\n*are* clear in their condemnation of homosexual behavior, and that\\'s the sum \\ntotal of what the Bible says about same-sex intercourse.\\n\\nI can appreciate (from personal experience) your desire to have everything \\nsimple, cut-and-dried, black-and-white, what-I-want- is-ok, and \\nthose-who-oppose-me-are-wicked.  However, I do not think the Bible makes your \\ncase as definitively as you would like it to.  In fact, I don\\'t believe it says \\nanything positive about your case at all.  Yes, I know the verses about loving \\none another, and not judging one another, but that\\'s not really the issue, is \\nit?  You know and admit that there are still things that are sinful for \\nChristians to do, since you say it is wrong for Christians to condemn you.  \\nTherefore, the issue is whether the Bible says homosexual intercourse is a sin.  \\nEven if you do challenge the clarity of the New Testament verses, you are still \\nleft with the fact that the only thing the Bible does say clearly about \\nhomosexual intercourse is that it is an abomination that defiles both those who \\nare under the law and those who are not.\\n\\n- Mark\\n\\n\\n[Actually I don\\'t think the reaction to the comparision with\\nbestiality is based on bestialophobia.  I think what he regards as\\nslimey is the rhetorical approach of connecting homosexuality and\\nbestiality.  Most people who accept homosexuality take a radical\\napproach to the Law.  They regard all of Lev as not binding on\\nChristians.  The argument is that there\\'s no way in the text to\\nseparate bestiality, homosexuality, and wearing mixed fabrics.  This\\ndoes not mean that such people have no limits on their conduct, nor\\ndoes it mean that they accept bestiality.  It simply means that their\\nsexual ethics does not come from the Law, and particularly not from\\nLev.  --clh]\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

This implies that observing x does not\\nprovide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between\\nthe respective possibilities that A and B are operative; the difference\\nreduces to the difference between the (unknown and unhelpful) prior\\nprobabilities P(A) and P(B):\\n\\n  P(x | A) = P(x | B)  ==>\\n\\n    P(A | x)  =  k P(A),   and   P(B | x)  =  k P(B)\\n\\nwhere k  =  P(x | A) / P(x)  =  P(x | B) / P(x).\\n\\nSo A and B are \"equally consistent with the data\" in that observing x\\ndoesn\\'t give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative.\\n\\nIn the particular case where A = H and B = HG, however, we know that their\\nprior probabilities are ordered by P(H) >= P(HG), although we don\\'t know\\nthe actual values, and it\\'s this which allows us to deploy the Razor to\\nthrow out any such HG.\\n\\n> Also, in the \"real world\" it isn\\'t as clear cut and dry it seems \\n> to me.

I\\'m not a Baysian statistician (nor any type of \\n> statistician), so this would be very helpful. \\n\\nNot that I\\'m a statistician as such either, but:\\n\\nThe idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of\\nthe (read `my\\') observations to date. However, theism (of the type with\\nwhich I am concerned) *also* suggests that, for instance, prayer may be\\nanswered, people may be miraculously healed (both are in principle amenable\\nto statistical verification) and that god/s may generally intervene in\\nmeasurable ways.\\n\\nThis means that these regions of the space of possible observations, \\nwhich I loosely termed \"appearances of god/s\", have some nonzero\\nprobability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic.\\n\\nSince there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to\\nscatter around over the observation space, the probability which theism\\nexpends on making \"appearances of god/s\" possible must come from somewhere\\nelse (i.e. other possible observations).\\n\\nAll else being equal, this means that an observation which *isn\\'t* an\\n\"appearance of god/s\" must have a slightly higher probability under\\natheism than under theism. The Bayesian stuff implies that such\\nobservations must cause my running estimate for the probability of\\nthe atheistic hypothesis to increase, with a corresponding decrease\\nin my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis.\\n\\nSorry if that\\'s still a bit jargonesque, but it\\'s rather difficult to\\nput it any other way, since it does depend intimately on the properties\\nof conditional probability densities, and particularly that the total\\narea under them is always unity.\\n\\nAn analogy may (or may not :-) be helpful. Say that hypothesis A is \"the\\ncoin is fair\", and that B is \"the coin is unfair (two-headed)\". (I\\'ve\\nused A and B to avoid confusion with H[heads] and T[tails].)\\n\\nThen\\n\\n  P(H | A) = 0.5  }  total 1\\n  P(T | A) = 0.5  }\\n\\n  P(H | B) = 1    }  total 1\\n  P(T | B) = 0    }\\n\\nThe observations are a string of heads, with no tails. This is compatible\\nwith both a fair coin (A) and a two-headed coin (B). However, the probability\\nexpended by A on making possible the appearance of tails (even though they\\ndon\\'t actually appear) must come from somewhere else, since the total must\\nbe unity, and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance\\nof heads.\\n\\nSay our running estimates at time n-1 are e[n-1](A) and e[n-1](B). The\\nobservation x[n] at time n is another head, x[n] = H. The estimates are\\nmodified according to\\n\\n                            P(H | A)\\n  e[n](A)   =   e[n-1](A) * --------   =   e[n-1](A) * m\\n                              P(H)\\n\\nand\\n\\n                            P(H | B)\\n  e[n](B)   =   e[n-1](B) * --------   =   e[n-1](B) * 2m\\n                              P(H)\\n\\nNow we don\\'t know P(H), the *actual* prior probability of a head, but\\nthe multiplier for e(A) is half that for e(B). This is true every time\\nthe coin is tossed and a head is observed.\\n\\nThus whatever the initial values of the estimates, after n heads, we have\\n\\n                 n\\n  e[n](A)   =   m  e[0](A)\\n\\nand\\n                    n\\n  e[n](B)   =   (2m)  e[0](B),\\n\\nand since e[k](A) + e[k](B) = 1 at any time k, you can show that 0.5 < m < 1\\nand thus 1 < 2m < 2. Hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesis A must\\ndecrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesis B must\\nincrease, even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads.\\n\\nThe loose analogy is between \"unfair coin\" and atheism, and between \"fair\\ncoin\" and theism, with observations consistent with both. A tail, which\\nwould falsify \"unfair coin\", is analogous to an \"appearance of god/s\",\\nwhich would falsify atheism. I am *not* claiming that the analogy extends\\nto the numerical values of the various probabilities, just that the principle\\nis the same.\\n\\n>> Constant observation of no evidence for gods, if evidence for them \\n>                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n>> is at all possible under the respective theisms, constantly increases\\n>  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n>> the notional estimated probability that they don\\'t exist, \\n\\n> It\\'s important to draw a distinction between theism that could\\n> be supported or not supported by evidence and theism that can\\'t.\\n> Given a theism for which evidence is in principle not possible,\\n> it doesn\\'t make sense to say \"lack of evidence\" supports the contrary \\n> view.\\n\\nQuite so, but this type of theism is what I might call \"the G in the HG\",\\nin terms of our Ockham\\'s Razor discussion, and I\\'d bin it on those grounds.\\n\\n> So it depends upon your conception of this god.

All of the \"experts\" and \\n          \"authorities\" said so. \\n          \\n               For example, Simon Newcomb declared in 1901:  \"The \\n          demonstration that no possible combination of known \\n          substances, known forms of machinery and known forms of \\n          force, can be united in a practical machine by which man \\n          shall fly long distances through the air, seems to the writer \\n          as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any \\n          physical fact to be.\" \\n          \\n               Fortunately, a few SMART people such as the Wright \\n          Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final \\n          word.  Now we take airplanes for granted, (except when they \\n          crash). \\n          \\n               Today, orthodox physicists and other \"scientists\" are \\n          saying similar things against several kinds of \\'Free Energy\\' \\n          Technologies, using negative terms such as \"pseudo-science\" \\n          and \"perpetual motion\", and citing so-called \"laws\" which \\n          assert that \"energy cannot be created or destroyed\" (\"1st law \\n          of thermodynamics\") and \"there is always a decrease in useful \\n          energy\" (\"2nd law of thermodynamics\").  The physicists do not \\n          know how to do certain things, so they ARROGANTLY declare \\n          that those things cannot be done.  Such PRINCIPLES OF \\n          IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern \"science\" and help to \\n          cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox \\n          modern theories. \\n          \\n               Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a \\n          seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe, with-\\n          OUT burning any kind of fuel, making them the PERFECT \\n          SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and its associated \\n          pollution, degradation, and depletion of the environment. \\n          \\n               Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy, \\n          but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by \\n          various forms of induction.  UNLIKE solar or wind devices, \\n          they need little or no energy storage capacity, because they \\n          can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed.  Solar energy \\n          has the DIS-advantage that the sun is often blocked by \\n          clouds, trees, buildings, or the earth itself, or is reduced \\n          by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and \\n          high latitudes.  Likewise, wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and \\n          often non-existent.  Neither solar nor wind power are \\n          suitable to directly power cars and airplanes.  Properly \\n          designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations. \\n          \\n               For example, at least three U.S. patents (#3,811,058, \\n          #3,879,622, and #4,151,431) have so far been awarded for \\n          motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS, seemingly \\n          tapping into energy circulating through the earth\\'s magnetic \\n          field.  The first two require a feedback network in order to \\n          be self-running.  The third one, as described in detail in \\n          \"Science & Mechanics\" magazine, Spring 1980, (\"Amazing \\n          Magnet-Powered Motor\", by Jorma Hyypia, pages 45-48, 114-117, \\n          and front cover), requires critical sizes, shapes, \\n          orientations, and spacings of magnets, but NO feedback.  Such \\n          a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible \\n          heatpump in one\\'s home, YEAR ROUND, FOR FREE.

They typically have a \\'SPARK GAP\\' in the circuit \\n          which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the \\n          energy being tapped.  It is important that the total \\n          \\'inductance\\' and \\'capacitance\\' of the Device combine to \\n          \\'RESONATE\\' at the same frequency as \\'EARTH RESONANCE\\' in \\n          order to maximize the power output.  This output can also be \\n          increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the \\'NEUTRAL CENTER\\' \\n          of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet.  In the case of a \\n          Tesla Coil, slipping a \\'TOROID CHOKE COIL\\' around the \\n          secondary coil will enhance output power.  [\"Earth Energy: \\n          Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems\", by John Bigelow, 1976, \\n          Health Research, P.O. Box 70, Mokelumne Hill, CA  95245.] \\n          \\n               During the 1930\\'s, an Austrian civil engineer named \\n          Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an \\n          \\'IMPLOSION TURBINE\\' (German name, \\'ZOKWENDLE\\'), after \\n          analyzing erosion, and lack of erosion, in differently shaped \\n          waterways, and developing sophisticated mathematical \\n          equations to explain it.  As described in the book \"A \\n          Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources\", by Dan A. Davidson, \\n          1977, water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a \\n          LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a \\n          CRITICAL VELOCITY.  The water then IMPLODES, no longer \\n          touching the inside walls of the tubing, and drives the pump, \\n          which then converts the pump\\'s motor into an ELECTRIC \\n          GENERATOR.  The device seems to be tapping energy from that \\n          of the earth\\'s rotation, via the \\'Coriolis effect\\', LIKE A \\n          TORNADO.  [ It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY! ] \\n          \\n               A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the \\'McClintock \\n          Air Motor\\' (U.S. Patent #2,982,261), which is a cross between \\n          a diesel engine (it has three cylinders with a compression \\n          ratio of 27 to 1) and a rotary engine (with solar and \\n          planetary gears).  It burns NO FUEL, but becomes self-running \\n          by driving its own air compressor.  This engine also \\n          generates a lot of heat, which could be used to heat \\n          buildings; and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large \\n          trucks, preventing their slowing down when climbing hills.  \\n          [David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the \\n          automatic transmission, differential, and 4-wheel drive.] \\n          \\n               Crystals may someday be used to supply energy, as shown \\n          in the Star Trek shows, perhaps by inserting each one between \\n          metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of \\n          particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a \\n          common household smoke detector. \\n          \\n               One other energy source should be mentioned here, \\n          despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free \\n          Energy.  A Bulgarian-born American Physicist named Joseph \\n          Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION \\n          reactor which he calls \\'Migma\\', which uses NON-radioactive \\n          deuterium as a fuel [available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities \\n          from sea water], does NOT produce radioactive waste, can be \\n          converted DIRECTLY into electricity (with-OUT energy-wasting \\n          steam turbines), and can be constructed small enough to power \\n          a house or large enough to power a city.  And UNLIKE the \\n          \"Tokamaks\" and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about, \\n          Migma WORKS, already producing at least three watts of power \\n          for every watt put in.  [\"New Times\" (U.S. version), 6-26-78, \\n          pages 32-40.] \\n          \\n               And then there are the \\'cold fusion\\' experiments that \\n          have been in the news lately, originally conducted by \\n          University of Utah researchers B. Stanley Pons and Martin \\n          Fleischmann.  Some U.S. Navy researchers at the China Lake \\n          Naval Weapons Center in California, under the direction of \\n          chemist Melvin Miles, finally took the trouble to collect the \\n          bubbles coming from such an apparatus, had them analyzed with \\n          mass-spectrometry techniques, and found HELIUM 4, which \\n          PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place, and enough \\n          of it to explain the excess heat generated. \\n          \\n               There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two so-called \"laws\" \\n          of thermodynamics are NOT so \"absolute\".  For example, the \\n          late Physicist Dewey B. Larson developed a comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \\n          calls the \\'Reciprocal System\\', (which he describes in detail \\n          in several books such as \"Nothing But Motion\" (1979) and \"The \\n          Universe of Motion\" (1984)), in which the physical universe \\n          has TWO DISTINCT HALVES, the material half and an anti-matter \\n          half, with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing \\n          between them, with-OUT the \"heat death\" predicted by \\n          thermodynamic \"laws\".  His Theory explains the universe MUCH \\n          BETTER than modern orthodox theories, including phenomena \\n          that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching \\n          their heads about, and is SELF-CONSISTENT in every way.  Some \\n          Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow, \\n          seemingly converting \"low-quality energy\" into \"high-quality \\n          energy\". \\n          \\n               Also, certain religious organizations such as \\'Sant Mat\\' \\n          and \\'Eckankar\\' teach their Members that the physical universe \\n          is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of \\n          existence, like parallel universes, or analogous to TV \\n          channels, as described in books like \"The Path of the \\n          Masters\", by Dr. Julian Johnson, 1939, and \"Eckankar: The Key \\n          to Secret Worlds\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, 1969.  For example, \\n          the next level up from the physical universe is commonly \\n          called the \\'Astral Plane\\'.  Long-time Members of these groups \\n          have learned to \\'Soul Travel\\' into these higher worlds and \\n          report on conditions there.  It seems plausible that energy \\n          could flow down from these higher levels into the physical \\n          universe, or be created at the boundary between them, given \\n          the right configuration of matter to channel it.  This is \\n          supported by many successful laboratory-controlled \\n          experiments in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world, such as \\n          those described in the book \"Psychic Discoveries Behind the \\n          Iron Curtain\". \\n          \\n               In terms of economics, the market has FAILED.  Inventors \\n          do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop \\n          and mass-produce Free Energy Equipment, and the conventional \\n          energy producer$ have no desire to do so because of their \\n          VE$TED INTERE$T$.  The government is needed to intervene.  If \\n          the government does not intervene, then the total supply of \\n          energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and \\n          will soon run out, prices for energy will increase, and \\n          pollution and its harmful effects (including the \\'GREENHOUSE \\n          EFFECT\\', acid rain, smog, radioactive contamination, oil \\n          spills, rape of the land by strip mining, etc.) will continue \\n          to increase. \\n          \\n               The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development \\n          of Free Energy by Inventors and universities, subsidize \\n          private production (until the producers can make it on their \\n          own), and subsidize consumption by low-income consumers of \\n          Free Energy Hardware. \\n          \\n               The long-range effects of such government intervention \\n          would be wide-spread and profound.  The quantity of energy \\n          demanded from conventional energy producer$ (coal mining \\n          companie$, oil companie$ and countries, electric utilitie$, \\n          etc.) would drop to near zero, forcing their employees to \\n          seek work elsewhere.  Energy resources (coal, uranium, oil, \\n          and gas) would be left in the ground.  Prices for \\n          conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero, \\n          while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high \\n          but drop as supply increases (as happened with VCR\\'s, \\n          personal computers, etc.).  Costs of producing products that \\n          require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease, \\n          along with their prices to consumers.  Consumers would be \\n          able to realize the \"opportunity costs\" of paying electric \\n          utility bills or buying home heating fuel.  Tourism would \\n          benefit and increase because travelers would not have to \\n          spend their money for gasoline for their cars.  Government \\n          tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be \\n          obtained in some other way.  AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE \\n          USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR. \\n          \\n               Many conventional energy producer$ would go out of \\n          business, but society as a whole, and the earth\\'s environment \\n          and ecosystems, would benefit greatly.  It is the People, \\n          that government should serve, rather than the big \\n          corporation$ and bank$. \\n          \\n\\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \\n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (patents, articles, books). \\n\\n          \\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \\n          IMPORTANT Information is ENCOURAGED. \\n\\n\\n                                   Robert E.

I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism.\\n#>#The point is that theism is *a* factor.\\n#>\\n#>That\\'s your claim; now back it up.  I consider your argument as useful\\n#>as the following:  Belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism.  Therefore\\n#>belief is *a* factor in fanaticism.  True, and utterly useless.  (Note, this\\n#>is *any* belief, not belief in Gods)\\n#>\\n# \\n#Tiring to say the least. I have backed it up, read the first statement.\\n\\nI have read it.  Conspicuous by its absence is any evidence or point.\\n\\n# \\n#The latter is the fallacy of the wrong analogy. Saying someone believes\\n#something is hardly an information about the person at all. Saying someone\\n#is a theist holds much more information. Further, the correlation between\\n#theists and fanatism is higher than that between belief at all and fanatism\\n#because of the special features of theistic belief.\\n\\nTruth by blatant assertion.  Evidence?\\n# \\n# \\n#>#>Gullibility,\\n#>#>blind obedience to authority, lack of scepticism, and so on, are all more\\n#>#>reliable indicators.  And the really dangerous people - the sources of\\n#>#>fanaticism - are often none of these things.

I wonder if there is any\\n#base of discussion left after such a statement. As a matter of fact, I think\\n#you are ignorant of human nature.

What makes you think that\\ntheist leaders believe what they say?  Especially when they say\\none thing and do another, or say one thing closely followed by its\\nopposite?  The practice is not restricted to theism, but it\\'s there\\nfor anyone to see.  It\\'s almost an epidemic in this country.\\n\\nJust for instance, if it is harder for a camel to pass thru\\' the eye\\nof a needle, why is the Catholic church such a wealthy land-owner?  Why\\nare there churches to the square inch in my country?\\n# \\n#>#>Now, *some*\\n#>#>brands of theism, and more precisely *some* theists, do tend to fanaticism,\\n#>#>I grant you.

Ever read Animal Farm?\\n#>#>\\n#>#That\\'s a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to\\n#>#repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to\\n#>#fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is,\\n#>#there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism.\\n#>\\n#>No, some of it comes from features which *some* theism has in common\\n#>with *some* fanaticism.    Your last statement simply isn\\'t implied by\\n#>what you say before, because you\\'re trying to sneak in \"innate features\\n#>of [all] theism\".  The word you\\'re groping for is \"some\".\\n#>\\n# \\n#Bogus again. Not all theism as is is fanatic. However, the rest already\\n#gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and\\n#theism. And further, the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them\\n#to switch to fanatism easily. It takes just a nifty improvement in the\\n#theology.\\n\\nTruth by blatant assertion.  \\n# \\n# \\n#>#Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.\\n#>\\n#>No shit, Sherlock.  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism,\\n#>since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have, as opposed\\n#>to the case you are trying to make?\\n#>\\n# \\n#Because there is more about theism that the attraction to gullible people\\n#causing the correlation. And the whole discussion started that way by the\\n#statement that theism is meaningfully correlated to fanatism, which you\\n#challenged.\\n\\nIndeed I did.  As I recall, I asked for evidence.  What is the correlation\\nof which you speak?  \\n# \\n# \\n#>#And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw\\n#>#men.

Yes, it is possible to evaluate that\\n#it is rational in a system that is not rational by the fallacies of that\\n#system, but since the validity of the axioms is agreed upon, that has as\\n#little impact as the possibility of a demon ala Descartes.\\n\\nThis just doesn\\'t parse, sorry.\\n# \\n#So far it just a matter of consistency.

This just really blew my socks off.  Read I Tim\\n1: 3-11.  Verses 3-8 speaks against those who have perverted the teachings of\\nthe Mosaic Law.  In vv.9-10, we have, *IN ORDER*, the 5th thru the 9th\\ncommandments and in the midst of this listing is \"homosexuals.\"  The decalogue,\\nabove everything else, is seen as God\\'s absolute.  If you don\\'t believe in\\nabsolutes, then you have nothing do do with Jehovah of the OT, which Paul\\nreveals to be the Messiah of the NT. \"Lord Christ Jesus\" transliterates to read\\n\"Jehovah\\'s Anointed Savior.\"  \\n  In I Cor5, we see the same emphasis of moral separation from the pagan\\ngentiles as we do in Lev 18-20.  In I Cor 6:9-10, only one notation (drunkards)\\nis not found in Lev 18-20.  Paul was not naive in his use of the LXX.  He knew\\nfull well how he was using the Law of God that was given in the OT, for\\napplication in the NT.  As I\\'ve said, the Law was fulfilled, not done away\\nwith.\\n\\n>>of questions we are trying to deal with.

It is unfair to take Paul\\'s\\n>>judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make\\n>>judgements on these questions.\\n\\nThis understanding is thoroughly rebutted in DeYoungs article that is being\\nposted.  Please refer to it.\\n\\n>\\n>One of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument\\n>is because Paul probably did face this and other problems. \\n\\nWe can do better than \"probably\" which is not an adequate defense against the\\nstatement that Paul\\'s culture didn\\'t have the same understanding of\\nhomosexuality as ours.  \\nAgain read the article because it uses facts.\\n\\n>>I claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is\\n>>not entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.\\n>\\n>I don\\'t see how you come to that conclusion.\\n\\nI think I do, because I have worked in the homosexual community by means of\\nworking with AIDs patients.  The pastoral is merely the practical application\\nof the theological truth however.  Those who are working thru the issue of\\nhomosexuality need to have our love and understanding just as with a friend who\\nis contiplating cheating on his wife or a friend who lives with his girlfriend,\\nyet you continue to witness to him.  But, once the choice is made, and there is\\nno remorse, then I feel that Paul\\'s \"pastoral\" care, as presented in the\\nCorinthian Church, come to bear significance.  THe one in active rebellion\\nshould be placed outside of the church if a believer, and if a non-believer,\\nthen one wipes his sandels and leaves it in Gods hand.  If there was a member\\nin your youth group who was constantly pawing at the little girls, you wouldn\\'t\\nhesitate to deal with the matter quickly and decisivly.  That, in part, betrays\\nthe present \"political correctness\" of the issue.  Pederasty is not accepted at\\nthe present, but some how we are to accept homosexuality because the latter is\\npolitically correct, while the former is not -at least not yet.  THis is how\\nthe morals decay.  \\n\\nI guess this would follow the liberal application in the political realm of\\neconomics.  The liberals want to tax the rich in the federal, yet in their own\\nstates, when they try to get businesses to settle there, they give tax\\nincentives to these same richies.  It comes down to a moral code of\\nrelativeness, or to use the cultural thing, politically correct -at the moment.\\n--Rex\\n\\n[You might want to look over 1 Tim 1:10 again.  If this is really the\\n5th through 9th commandments, we seem to be missing thieves, and\\nhomosexuals would have to be fit in under adultery.  This is of course\\npossible if \"arsenokoitia\" has a narrower meaning than homosexuality\\nin general, but I think that\\'s not your thesis.  I have no objection\\nper se to the idea that the author of 1 Tim might have quoted the 10\\ncommandments, but 5 through 9, minus one and plus a few things, begins\\nto look a bit marginal.  --clh]\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

[....]\\n\\nUnfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark\\nrecesses of the art of computing.  What little they do see is from the view\\ngiven to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, \\'hacker\\'\\nis not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.\\n\\nI, on the other hand, know what \\'hacker\\' means from those who consider\\nthemselves such.  Following is the definition from \"Jargon File 2.9.10\".\\n(This is also known as the \"Hackers Dictionary\".)  The definitions are\\narranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:\\n\\n   :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.\\n     1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable\\n     systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most\\n     users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who\\n     programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys\\n     programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A\\n     person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is\\n     good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,\\n     or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in \\'a UNIX\\n     hacker\\'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who\\n     fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One\\n     might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the\\n     intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing\\n     limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to\\n     discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence \\'password\\n     hacker\\', \\'network hacker\\'.  See {cracker}.\\n\\n     The term \\'hacker\\' also tends to connote membership in the global\\n     community defined by the net (see {network, the} and\\n     {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described\\n     is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see\\n     {hacker ethic, the}).\\n\\n     It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe\\n     oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an\\n     elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new\\n     members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego\\n     satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if\\n     you claim to be one and are not, you\\'ll quickly be labeled\\n     {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.\\n\\n   :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing\\n     is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of\\n     hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and\\n     facilitating access to information and to computing resources\\n     wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun\\n     and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits\\n     no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.\\n\\n     Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no\\n     means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe\\n     to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and\\n     giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that\\n     *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary\\n     control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU}\\n     project.\\n\\n     Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of\\n     cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.\\n     But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who\\n     see themselves as `benign\\' crackers (see also {samurai}).  On\\n     this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy\\n     to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,\\n     preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it\\n     was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an\\n     unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.\\n\\n     The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker\\n     ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share\\n     technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing\\n     resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as\\n     {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address})\\n     can function without central control because of this trait; they\\n     both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be\\n     hackerdom\\'s most valuable intangible asset.\\n\\n:  Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is\\n:  a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large.\\n: To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who\\n: says \"Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate...\" :-)\\n\\nNote that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing\\nlimself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better\\nnot to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of \\'hacker\\'.  So,\\nin order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary\\nto borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the\\nworkplace.  (This means that \\'hacker\\' is defined in terms of some well-known\\nand respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.\\n\\n: >No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesn\\'t work that way.\\n:  Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)\\n\\nLanguage works anyway that we want it to work.  The purpose of language is\\nto communicate.

King (king@ctron.com) posts a whopping one liner:\\n\\n * \"The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be *\\n *  treated as a matter of faith.\" -- Francis Hitching                     *\\n\\n  I have a few points to make about the above posting.\\n\\n    1. Science is not based on and does not consist of \"quotes\" from either\\n    real or alleged experts.  Critical reasoning, evidence and (if possible)\\n    experimentation are necessary.  Creationists frequently display a massive\\n    confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike\\n    (some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to\\n    follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure.  This strongly suggests\\n    that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they\\n    are aware of this fatal deficiency.  Of course, you may not actually be a\\n    creationist and this may not be your real intent.\\n\\n    2. You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his\\n    statement.  Why is that?  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the\\n    quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.\\n    Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context\\n    and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate\\n    scientists.  Of course, you may not actually be a creationist and this may\\n    not be your real intent.\\n\\n    3. Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of \"the modern theory of\\n    evolution\" would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one\\n    line quote from an unidentified nobody.  It is also important to note that\\n    disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate\\n    claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck\\n    proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid.  Creationists seem rather fond\\n    of diving (head first) into this logical fallacy.  Of course, you may not\\n    actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent.\\n\\n    4. Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science, an attack\\n    on evolution (either the fact or the theory) really represents an attack on\\n    science.  While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve (B^) the\\n    fact of evolution will not ever go away.  Creationists lost the battle long\\n    ago (more than 100 years in fact) but are simply too willfully ignorant and\\n    irrational to acknowledge the fact.  Of course, you may not actually be a\\n    creationist and you may not really be that ignorant.\\n\\n\\nWarren Kurt vonRoeschlaub (kv07@IASTATE.EDU) asks:\\n\\n * Neither I, nor Webster\\'s has ever heard of Francis Hitchings.  Who is he? *\\n\\n  I, like Hitchings, am not to be found in Webster\\'s B^).  Francis Hitchings\\nis a scientifically illiterate creationist (or perhaps he is just playing the\\npart of one) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution (\"The Neck of\\nthe Giraffe\").  In that publication he quotes a creationist (Jean Sloat Morton)\\nusing the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could\\nnot have formed by chance.  Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution\\n(the two are quite independent) but also concluding with a \"non sequitur\" (i.e.\\nthe conclusion \"does not follow\"). [pp 70-71]  Hitchings also misquotes Richard\\nLewontin in an effort to support creationism. [pp 84]\\n\\n  Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber\\nin the Los Angeles Times (and repeated in the Oregonian).  The article was\\ntitled \"`Giraffe\\' sticks scientific neck out too far\".  Excerpts include :\\n\\n  \"Francis Hitchings is not a biologist.\"  \"He goes after Darwin like Mark\\n  Antony after Brutus.  He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and\\n  pseudo-science with the sinuosity of a snake-oil salesman.\"  \"He suggests\\n  a mystical `organizing principle\\' of life, using the similarity of organs\\n  in different creatures as evidence [sic].\"\\n\\n  Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution not\\nagainst it.

I suggest, however, that before trying to\\nunderstand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms. \\n\\nKevin, take a look at the references I mentioned, and think again.\\nI still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind\\nare neurologists, neuropsychologists and biologists (but do not \\nflame me for my opinions), since they study beings that are\\nconscious. \\n\\nThe reason I am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot\\nlead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different.\\n\\nAnd please, do not bring QM into this discussion at all - not\\nall physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness\\nplays some special role in physics. I would say it doesn\\'t.\\n\\n> The other problem with algorithms is their instability.

Also,\\n> neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate -\\n> can an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it\\'s\\n> code?\\n\\nAgain, _brains are not computers_. Don\\'t forget this. This does not\\nmean they need something else to work - they just work differently.\\nTheir primary \\'purpose\\' is perception and guidance of action, \\nself-awareness and high intelligence are later appearances.\\n\\n> The next problem is the sticky question of \"What is colour?\" (replace\\n> \\'colour\\' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the\\n> materialist viewpoint is that it\\'s the product of some kind of\\n> chemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +\\n> different chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these?\\n\\nYou are still expecting that we could find the idea of \\'green\\' in\\nour brains somewhere, perhaps in the form of some chemical. This is\\nnot how I see it. The sensation \\'green\\' is a certain time-dependent\\npattern in the area V4 of our visual cortex, and it is distributed\\nwith the help of areas V1 and V2 to the rest of the brain. \\n\\nIndeed, a firing pattern. I have sometimes thought of our consciousness\\nas a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns,\\nbut this is just idle speculation.\\n\\nScientific American\\'s September 1992 issue was a special issue on\\nmind and brain. Have you already read it from cover to cover? ;-)\\nThere are two articles on visual perception, so you might be \\ninterested.\\n\\nBut again, please note that subjective experiences cannot be \\nobserved from a third-person perspective. If we see nothing but \\nneuronal activity, we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the\\nmind.\\n\\nKalat (1988) writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation\\nof different areas of brain have led to various changes in the \\npatients\\' state of mind. For instance, a patient whose septal area\\nwas stimulated (without his knowledge) by remote control during\\na psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression, and\\nstarted discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend.\\n\\nStimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing\\nsituations, when the patients have started flirting with the\\ntherapist.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there is evidence that\\n\\n1) brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences, \\n   brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage\\n\\n2) conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in\\n   various areas of brain - when we think of colours, our\\n   visual cortex is activated etc.\\n\\n3) consciousness is an afterthought - we become conscious of our\\n   actions with a half a second delay, and our brains are ahead\\n   of our \\'conscious will\\' by at least 350 ms. \\n\\nThus, I think it is fruitful to turn the question \"Why do \\'I\\' see\\ncolours\" around and ask \"What is this \\'I\\' that seems to be \\nobserving?\", since it seems that our conscious mind is not\\nthe king of our brains.\\n\\n> If this is so, a\\n> computer won\\'t see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an\\n> algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an\\n> equivalent that doesn\\'t? It shouldn\\'t, because the outputs of each\\n> algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do\\n> we see colour?\\n\\nThis depends on what is meant by \\'seeing colours\\'. Does a neural\\nnetwork that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from\\n0 to 9 see the numbers, if it is capable of sorting them?\\n\\nIf you are asking, \"why does an animal who is conscious of itself\\nas an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who\\ndoesn\\'t\", I have a good answer - read my previous posting,\\nwhere I wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap\\nroles and act more morally, so that they don\\'t unconsciously\\nkill each other with newly discovered weapons. (A bit extreme,\\nbut this is the basic idea.)\\n\\nWhen early _Homo_ became more and more efficient in using tools, \\na sense of identity and the concept of \\'self\\' had to evolve in\\nline with this development. Indeed, respect for others and \\nconscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages\\nfor social animals, such as early humans. \\n\\n> If I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,\\n> with two processes acting on it.

I\\'ve \\nbeen compared to the famous Robert McElwaine by some readers of Sci. Med.\\nI didn\\'t know how to respond since I had not seen one of your posts(just \\nlike I haven\\'t read \"The Yeast Connection\").\\n\\nLet me just start by stating that the authors of the \"Cold Fusion\" papers of \\nrecent years are now in scientific exile(I believe that one has actually \\nleft the country).  Scientific fraud is rare.  I\\'m still not sure that if a \\nreview of the research notes of the \"cold fusion scientists\" actually \\nproved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation.\\n\\nYour sources do not seem to be research articles.  They are more like lay \\ntexts designed to pique human interest in a subject area(just like the food \\ncombining and life extension texts).  Robert, I try to keep an open mind.\\nBut some things I just can\\'t buy(one is taking SOD orally to prevent \\noxidative damage in the body).\\n\\nYour experiment, if conducted by readers of this news group, would prove \\nthat you are right(more ash after seed sprouting than before).  Unless you \\nuse a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature(above 600 degrees \\nI believe), you will get organic residue in the ash.  Even the residue in \\ncommercial incinerators contains organic residue.  I remember doing this \\nkind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I \\ncouldn\\'t find a temperature for mineral ash formation so I\\'m really \\nguessing at 600 degrees F, it may actually be much higher.  The point is \\nthat no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to \\nproduce *only* a mineral ash.  They also could not measure the minerals so \\nthey could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct. \\n\\nChemical reactions abound in our body, in our atmosphere, in our water and \\nin our soil.  Are these fusion reactions?  Yes many of them do involve \\nfusing oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics.  Do we \\nreally have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with \\nsilicon?  Not in my book Robert.\\n\\nSilicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet.  I\\'ve seen speculation \\nthat man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon \\nbased life-form.  I like reading science fiction, as many people do.  But I \\nknow enough about biochemistry(and nutrition) to be able(in most cases) to \\nseparate the fiction from the fact.\\n\\nSilicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in \\nhumans.  We have several grams of the stuff in our body.  What\\'s it doing \\nthere?  Only the Lord knows right now.  But I will tell you what I do know \\nabout silicon and why, as you state, it helps bone healing(and it is not \\nbecause silicon is transformed into calcium).\\n\\nAlmost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective \\ntissue(collagen and elastin).  There have been studies published which show \\nthat the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective \\nfactor against atherosclerosis(the higher the silicon content in elastin, \\nthe more resistant the elastin is to a an age-related loss of elasticity \\nwhich may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as \\npart of the ageing process in humans).\\n\\nFor bone fracture healing, the first step is a collagen matrix into which \\ncalcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts.  A high level of silicon \\nin the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation.  This first step in the \\nbone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going.\\nElectriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming \\ncells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in \\nthe gap(or gaps) between the ends of the broken bone.  A vitamin C deficiency\\n(by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of \\ndefective collagen) does slow down both bone and wound healing.  Zinc is also \\nanother big player in bone and wound healing.  And so is silicon(in an  \\nundetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not \\ntransformation of silicon to calcium).  For you to take this bone healing \\nobservation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into \\ncalcium is an interesting little trick.\\n\\nBut Robert, I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press(and \\nyes even some scientific papers).  Is the explanation reasonable?  Without \\na very good science knowledge base, you and most readers of this news group \\nare flying blind(you have to take it on faith because you don\\'t know any \\nbetter).\\n\\nIf the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base, \\nI\\'m inclined to consider it(this usually means trying to find other sources \\nthat come to the same conclusion).  If the idea(like a candida bloom) seems \\nto make sense to me, I tend to pursue it as long as any advice that I\\'m \\ngoing to give isn\\'t going to really mess somebody up.  If this makes us \\nkindred souls Robert, then I guess I\\'ll have to live with that label.\\n\\nFor the physicians who have decided to read my response to Robert\\'s \\ninteresting post, I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric \\nneurosurgeon last night on U.S. TV.  I can\\'t remember the network or his \\nname(like many nights, I was on my computer and my wife was watching TV in \\nour Den where I have my computer setup).  This neurosurgeon takes kids with \\nbrain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses\"unconventional\"\\ntreatments(his own words).  He says that he has a 70% success rate.  The one \\ncase that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation(conventional \\ntreatment).  He was going to go in and cut.  You guys complain about the \\ncost of the anti-fungals.  What do you think the cost difference between \\nradiation treatment and surgery is guys? \\n\\nI\\'m going to ask you guys one more time, why blast a physician who takes the \\nchronic sinus sufferer(like Jon) and the chronic GI sufferer(like Elaine)\\nand tries to help them using unconventional treatments?  Treatments which \\ndo not result in death(like those that the neurosurgeon uses?).  Is it \\nbecause candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors are?\\nHow about quality of life guys?  May the candida demon never cross your \\nsinus cavity or gut(if it does, you may feel differently about the issue).\\n\\nMarty B.\\n' ------------> sci.med\n",

In order to bring out the problems most clearly, I\\'ll\\nalso stipulate (what I think is far less plausible) that Paul coined the\\nterm for this usage.  The question I want to turn to is what that would\\nmean for Paul\\'s readers and for later Christians.  This should be shorter\\nthan my last note, as we will see that this question rapidly confronts us\\nwith some of the major divisions within Christ\\'s body, and I am not trying\\nto open the gates for flames across any of the terrible chasms that\\nseparate any of us from our fellow Christians.  My own biases (loosely\\ncharacterizable as \"liberal\") will be evident, but I am not grinding an\\naxe here, so much as trying to get all parties to see that it may be HARD\\nto reach \"closure\" when the issues involved strike at the heart of what we\\neach, in our own different ways, see as crucial to the Gospel of Christ.\\n\\nSo; stipulating Paul\\'s intent, the immediate question is: HOW CAN HIS\\nREADERS UNDERSTAND this intent?  And following on that question, there is\\na second one: WHAT IS OUR PROPER ACTION if we *do* manage to understand him?\\n\\nSince Paul gives not a single clue about his meaning in the text of 1st\\nCorinthians, there are two \"positive\" answers and one \"negative\" to this\\nquestion:\\n\\n+\\ta.  Paul (or Apollos, or someone) in the apostolic community has\\n\\t    conveyed to the Corinthians the then-traditional Jewish condem-\\n\\t    nation of homosexual behavior, and Paul expects them to be\\n\\t    sufficiently well-tutored by this tradition that he needs no\\n\\t    futher explanation.  [I should note that there is no evidence\\n\\t    in the letter, or in 2 Corinthians for such a supposition :-)]\\n\\n+\\tb.  The Spirit will teach us what Paul means (or, if not Paul,\\n\\t    what God means \"behind\" Paul\\'s inspired word-choice.)\\n\\n-\\tc.  We *don\\'t* know, and cannot guess to within any better pre-\\n\\t    cision here than, for comparison, in the parallel use by Paul,\\n\\t    in the same passage of the word  _pleonektai_ (\"those who have\\n\\t    more\" -- if you think that _areseonkoitai_ is \"obvious\" from\\n\\t    its roots, try cutting your teeth on *this* word!  The NEB\\n\\t    translates it as \"grabbers\") or even _methusoi_ (\"drunkards\"\\n\\t    -- at least this has the advantage of being a common insult,\\n\\t    so that at least there is *some* hint as to its meaning!)\\n\\nThe three positions more or less -- if I can be allowed some exaggeration\\nfor the sake of argument -- define a classical Catholic attitude towards\\ntradition, one form of Protestant _sola scriptura_, and a liberal/critical\\ndemand for evidence.  All three positions have strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\n_ad_ a:\\tIt is unquestionable that the gospel was preached in and by the\\n\\tcommunity of Christ\\'s disciples and their successors, and that\\n\\tour NT scripture itself emerges from this communal tradition.\\n\\tBut it\\'s also the case that we know little or nothing about this\\n\\ttradition until almost a century after Paul, which is to say that\\n\\twe have access to the tradition only after several generations of\\n\\tpossibly confused transmission.  The scripture is itself our only\\n\\tdocumentation of the tradition in the critical era.\\n\\n_ad_ b:\\tIf we are NOT born of water and Spirit [to revert to John in an\\n\\tattempt to explain Paul :-)], then we have no more hope of under-\\n\\tstanding the gospel than Nicodemus had; neither the traditions of\\n\\tmen nor the vain elevation of our own reason can prevent the Spirit\\n\\tfrom blowing where it will -- the Paraclete is a kamikaze.  But\\n\\tthe downside of Protestant belief in the efficacy of the Spirit\\n\\tas our guide in scripture is that the wing of Protestantism that\\n\\ttakes this most seriously is also the most fragmented over divergent\\n\\tunderstanding supposedly derived from the \"clear\" Word of God.\\n\\n\\t\\t[Note: classical Lutheran, Calvinist and Anglican thought\\n\\t\\tconstrains scripture to be read *within* tradition, even\\n\\t\\twhile reserving judgment against tradition out of scripture;\\n\\t\\tthe more bizarre forms of \"I will read Scripture my way\"\\n\\t\\tare primarily a fringe aspect of \"cultic\" Protestantism.]\\n\\n\\tThe main problem with this approach is that there is apparently no\\n\\tmeans for ONE person to convey to another what that one may feel\\n\\t*is* teaching received from the Spirit; and history shows incredible\\n\\tconflict between Christians on this point, each in his own mind\\n\\t\"convinced\" that he is led by the Spirit.  No one can seriously\\n\\turge point b without SOME sense of its potential for setting Christian\\n\\tagainst Christian.  To what purpose?\\n\\n_ad_ c:\\tThe critical approach has the distinct advantage that when it can\\n\\treach a conclusion, it can lay out the data in a way which is open\\n\\tto all.  The weakness is an obvious corollary: this is not usually\\n\\tpossible. :-)\\n\\n\\t[If I may say a word here, out of my own already acknowledged bias;\\n\\tone complaint against critical methodology is that it \"dissolves\"\\n\\tfaith -- but surely a \"faith\" that cannot honestly face the evalu-\\n\\tation of evidence has problems which mere theology is helpless to\\n\\taddress.]\\n\\nAnyway, there is a serious and unfortunate possibility of schism between\\n\"liberal\" and \"conservative\" positions, mostly on the basis of extreme\\nzealots of positions b and c.  A Catholic sense of authority and tradition\\ntends to constrain arguments of b contra c to secondary position, so that\\ndespite horrendous strains Rome is NOT as likely to find these issues as\\nultimately divisive as the Protestant world will.  And Anglicans will (I\\npredict) muddle through on the _via media_, attempting to give each position\\nits due, but no more than its due. \\n\\nSecond question.  Suppose tradition tells us, and lots of \"spiritual\"\\nChristians tell us, and critical thought at least admits as possible,\\nthat Paul is refering to a flat, universal Levitical prohibition against\\nmale-male sex.  What then?  Again, we can abdicate our personal responsi-\\nbility to tradition, and let it dictate the answer.  But it\\'s precisely\\nwhere inherited traditions are NOT questioned that they\\'re most dangerous.\\n\\nWe have EXAMPLES of Christ questioning the Pharisees and THEIR use of\\ntradition (despite his urging, in Matthew 23:2 that we are to heed them).\\nWe have EXAMPLES of Peter, and more radically still Paul, jettisoning the\\ntraditions that THEY were led by the Spirit to call into question.  Jesus\\nand Peter and Paul do not so much \"throw out\" tradition as subject it to\\nradical criticism, on a couple of very basic grounds:\\n\\n     \"the weightier demands of the law: justice and mercy and good faith\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(Matthew 23:23)\\nand  \"On these two commandments [love God & neighbor] hand the whole Law,\\n      and the Prophets, also.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(Matthew 22:40)\\n\\nIf there is a fundamental (because derived from Christ) validity in the\\nchallenge to *some* traditions, a validity that led the first generation\\nto go so far as to waive application of the Torah to gentile converts\\n(vastly beyond anything that is directly deducible from Jesus\\' reported\\nwords and deeds), it signifies to me a certain failure of the imagination\\nto *postulate* that *only* the traditions that we have specific challenges\\nagainst are in fact open to challenge.\\n\\nAll traditions passed *through* men are traditions *of* men.  That God may\\nlead us even so, that these traditions are a source of our spiritual\\ninstruction I will freely grant.  But tradition is inherently human, and\\ninherently corruptible (and given the Fall, corrupt).  Nothing in it is\\nimmune to challenge, when the Spirit shows us a failure in justice, mercy\\nand good faith.

That\\nthe Spirit may have taught another what She refuses to teach me (or I am\\ntoo dense to learn).  That tradition *might* have value here.  But what I\\n*know* of tradition is that on one occasion, some superstitious Christians\\nappealed to Justinian after an earthquake in Asia Minor, and scapegoated\\n\"sodomites\" as the \"cause\" of the earthquake, so that legislation was\\npassed making homosexual behavior a capital offense.  If that is in\\naccord with the gospel of Christ, then I am no Christian.  That is human\\ntradition at its most hateful and vicious.

I think\\nthere are two ways to use tradition.  One is to say that when Paul and\\nhis readers share a tradition, it makes sense to interpret his words\\nin the context of that shared tradition.  That\\'s what makes me think\\nthat these arguments over words turn out to be silly.  We know that\\nPaul came out of a background that was rather Puritanical on sex.\\nEverything else he says on sex is consistent with that background.\\nThe tone of his remarks on homosexuality in Rom 1 is consistent with\\nthat background.  Even if the words in the sin lists aren\\'t the most\\ngeneral terms for homosexual activity (and it seems to me that there\\'s\\nsome evidence that they are not), they are just one more piece of\\nevidence for something we would probably be willing to believe with no\\nevidence at all -- that Paul shares the common Jewish rejection of\\nhomosexuality.\\n\\nBut when you identify (a) with the Catholic position, that\\'s rather a\\nhorse of a different color.  The Catholic position involves a\\ncontinuing church tradition.  Arguments specific to that tradition\\nmight be (1) we can get guidance on how to interpret Paul\\'s original\\nmeaning from tradition, e.g. the way the Church Fathers interpreted\\nhim, and (2) we gain confidence that his prohibitions still apply in\\nour time because of the universal judgement of the church between his\\ntime and ours.  I think this is a somewhat different use of tradition.\\nA radical Protestant might be willing to use known 1st Cent.\\ntradition to illuminate Paul\\'s original meaning, but not use the\\nCatholic position to answer the question of what our own attitude to\\nhomosexuality should be.\\n\\n--clh]\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

Smith.  The introduction is written by\\nPaul Kurtz. \\n\\n\\tMormonism -- the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\\n\\t-- claims a worldwide membership 5.2 million.  It is one of\\n\\tthe world\\'s fastest growing religions, with as many as\\n\\t200,000 new converst in 1982 alone.  Because of the church\\'s\\n\\taggressive missionary program, covering more than one\\n\\thundred countries, it is spreading even to third world\\n\\tcountries.\\n\\t\\n\\tMormonism is both puritanical in moral outlook and\\n\\tevangelical in preachment.  The church is run along strict\\n\\tauthoritarian lines.  Led by a president, who allegedly\\n\\treceives revelations directly form God, and a group of\\n\\ttwelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in belief\\n\\tand practice, the church is opposed to abortion,\\n\\tpornography, sexual freedom, women\\'s rights, and other, in\\n\\tits view, immoral influences of secular society, and it\\n\\tforbids the use of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, and tea.\\n\\t\\n\\tCentered in Salt Lake City, the church is extremely wealthy\\n\\tand politically powerful in Utal and many other western\\n\\tstates.  Among well-know present-day Mormons are Ezra Taft\\n\\tBenson (former secretary of agriculture), the Osmond family,\\n\\tthe Mariotts of the hotel empire, and a score of high-placed\\n\\tgovernment officials.\\n\\t\\n\\tThe Mormon church was founded in western New York in 1830 by\\n\\tJoseph Smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had\\n\\tfound gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hill\\n\\tand that with the help of visits from the angel Moroni he\\n\\thad been able to translate the writing into the _Book of\\n\\tMormon_, the basis of Mormon belief.  This book, written \"by\\n\\tthe commandment of God,\" claims that the ancient Hebrews\\n\\tsettled in America about 600 B.C.E. and were the ancestors\\n\\tof the American Indians.  Mormons believe that those who\\n\\thave been baptized in the \"true church\" will be reunited\\n\\tafter death and that deceased non-Mormon family members can\\n\\tbe baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the\\n\\thereafter.  Because of these beliefs, Mormons have been\\n\\tconsidered outcasts by mainline Christian denominations and\\n\\tas heretics by religious fundamentalists.\\n\\t\\n\\tJoseph Smith was a controversial figure in his day -- he was\\n\\tboth worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud.  Because\\n\\tof persecution he led his band of loyal followers from\\n\\tPalmyra, New York, westward to Ohio and then to Illinois,\\n\\twhere in 1844 he was shot to death by an agry mob.  Brigham\\n\\tYoung, who reportedly had as many as eighty wives, took over\\n\\tthe leadership of the church and led the Mormons further\\n\\twestward, to found the new Zion in Salt Lake City. \\n\\tFollowing the teachings of Joseph Smith in the practice of\\n\\tpolygamy was perhaps the Mormons most controversial practice\\n\\tin nineteenth-century America.\\n\\t\\n\\tWhile other religions go back many centuries --\\n\\tMuhammadanism, 1200 years; Christianity, 2000; and Judaism,\\n\\t3000 -- and attempts to examine their beginnings are\\n\\tdifficult, extensive historical investigation of Mormon\\n\\troots is possible.  Some Mormons are willing to examine this\\n\\thistory objectively, bu others maintain that such scrutiny\\n\\tis dangerous to the faith.\\n\\t\\n\\tIn the following pages, _Free Inquiry_ presents two articles\\n\\tabout the Mormon church.  First, George D. Smith, a lifelong\\n\\tmember of the church, provides a detailed critical\\n\\texamination of Joseph Smith and his claim the the _Book of\\n\\tMormon_ was divinely revealed.  Second, we present a portion\\n\\tof an interview with philosopher Sterling McMurrin, also a\\n\\tMormon since birth, who questions the treatment of the\\n\\thistory of the church by Mormon authorities. -- Paul Kurtz\\n\\t\\n\\nThe article itself is super.\\n\\n  ,...,.,,\\n /666;    \\',    \\n////;    _~ -   \\n(/@/----0-~-0\\n ;\\'  . `` ~ \\\\\\'\\n  , `    \\' , >\\n;;|\\\\..((   -C---->> jimtims p00168@psilink.com \\n;;| >-  `.__),;;\\n\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

Sex, or Christianity?\\n\\nI\\'m afraid I see that question as very tendentious.  Try rephrasing it:\\n\\n\\tWhat\\'s more important to Christians?  Love of God or love\\n\\tof other human beings?\\n\\nto which of course the only conceivable answer is that the one is like\\nthe other.  I am *deeply* suspicious of any \"flavor\" of Christianity\\nwhich would elevate one clause of the Great Commandment to a \"priority\"\\nover the other such as to claim a conflict.  True, we are told to let\\nthe dead bury the dead, to \"hate\" family rather than let it keep us from\\nfollowing Christ.  But the dichotomy here is not one between love of our\\nfellows and love of God, but of allowing *social* constructs to blind us\\nto the presense of God.  It is particularly satanic to twist love of God\\nin such a manner as to become an excuse to treat others as on a different\\nlevel than the one who is so caught up in \"love\" of God.\\n\\nThe trouble comes in the relation of human love and human sex.  Yes, it\\nhas sometimes been the case that the Church has \"taught\" that all sex\\nwas nasty, evil, sinful stuff.  But when man and wife leave their parental\\nhomes to become helpmates, living in one flesh, it is the sex that is the\\nvehicle of becoming \"one flesh\" (if you doubt me, read St. Paul on what\\nis wrong with frequenting prostitutes :-)).  Less provocatively, what I\\nmean is just this: sexual bonding is a deeply founded aspect of our social\\ninteraction, and in particular is the foundation of the institution of\\nmarriage, so that unlike with many mammals, human males remain with and\\nfoster the children they beget and support their children\\'s mothers.\\nThis is the schema behind Genesis 2:18-24 (and behind Jesus\\' citation of\\nthat passage.)\\n\\n\\t[ I observe, by the way, that not all human males in fact do as\\n\\t  I have just described; but another thing that characterizes\\n\\t  human societies is our raising of *non*begotten children, not\\n\\t  only orphans and adoptees and the like, but products of the\\n\\t  quite common infidelities of humans to their spouses. We are\\n\\t  in this not unique in the animal world, but the full extent of\\n\\t  social consequences and implications is most intricate for us. ]\\n\\nYes, of course it sometimes goes \"wrong\" -- like all else we do, it is\\ninfected with sin, and you find married \"couples\" where there is no bond,\\nand people so deliriously addicted to the initial stages of sexual bond\\nformation (the \"infatuation\", \"falling in love\" phase) that they break\\nany forming bond in order to keep stepping over the threshold of the deep\\nunity God has prepared for us, and stepping back out again right away.\\nSatan may indeed *use* sex as a very handy tool to corrupt human love --\\nbut in the Edenic creation, that is not its nature, and with God\\'s grace\\nunder the power of Christ to make all things new it need not be a problem\\nfor Christians (though we must be vigilant, even in Christ, as the devil\\nis watchful, prowling around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.)\\n\\nSo, returning to the original question, what is more important to STRAIGHT\\nChristians?  Sex, or Christianity?  Paul, clearly, tended to think that\\nsex was at best a distraction from Christianity (though to be charitable\\nto him, his context was in expectation of immediate parousia, so that the\\nhard TASKS of a married union -- the lifelong building and adaptation to\\neach other -- seemed somehow to undercut the \"proper\" preparation for an\\nimmediate eschaton.  Since we *do not* know the hour of return, we should\\nact *both* with instant readiness for that *and* with a commitiment to our\\nmates that proposes a long lifetime together.  And telling people *not* to\\nbond in such a perspective strikes me as crippling us in the second clause\\nof the the commandment to love.  I would claim that only a very few saints\\nhave the CAPACITY to deeply love (without sexual tinges or complication,\\nmind you) their fellow human beings unless they have had a deeply spiritual\\nlife in married union growing together as one flesh -- and that means in\\nthe type case, with a persistent and continued sexual relationship.  We\\nare human, and little good comes of trying to \"mortify the flesh\" to the\\npoint of pretending to be otherwise, pretending NOT to be sexual beings.\\n\\n>Christianity I would hope.  Would they be willing to forgo sex\\n>completely, in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others,\\n\\nIt depends entirely on context.  If that context is major hypocrisy\\non the part of those who find us \"stumbling blocks\" I am much less of\\na mind to efface myself so that they can pontificate about MY sins.\\n\\nThere are some people for whom a life of celibacy is a spritual gift,\\nand maybe even a victory against a to-them troubling sexual urge that\\nseems to them to lead only to sin.  Nothing I say should ever be read\\nas demeaning such a gift.  Nor the even rarer gift of love for all our\\nconspecifics, and indeed for all God\\'s creation, that can develop to\\nthe full *without* the tutoring of a spousal/helpmate marriage founded\\nin sex.  But there is a difference between spiritual gifts and penance;\\ntelling people that they HAVE to have a particular gift (or else? what?)\\nis fraught with manipulation and disregard of the differences of our\\nspiritual endowments from God.  To one person is given the gift of\\nspeaking in toungues, to another intepretation of toungues; to yet\\nanother prophecy; and to still another teaching.  The notion that some\\n*particular* gift is required of *all* is one of the earliest heresies.\\n-- \\nMichael L.

Modern Pentecostalism was developing\\nas a predominantly \\'colored\\' phenomenon.  Here, there was great fanaticism,\\nemphasis on emotional experiences, and belief in a personal guidance and\\nindwelling of the Holy Spirit.\\n\\tMany \\'white\\' Protestant churches were growing into what became known\\nas conservative fundamentalism.  By the 1940s, the evangelical movement was\\nin full swing, and many groups were becoming part of it.\\n\\tWhen the civil rights movement grew stronger (in the 1950\\'s and \\n1960\\'s),\\nmany \\'white\\' church groups began to be influenced by the \\'black\\' churches and\\nby what was going on there.  This spread started in the most liberal of groups\\nand spread to the more conservative ones by the late \\'60\\'s.  In 1969, even the\\nCatholic Church was displaying evidence of influence by the other \\ngroups...still\\nevident today.\\n\\n\\tThe Churches of Christ are (and were) a very conservative Protestant\\ngroup.  When the influence from outside began to reach the CofC in c.1965, it\\nwas generally not appreciated.  Conservative groups are very strongly \\nresistant\\nto change, and the new movement was VERY different from the CofC status quo.\\n\\tThe magazines put out at that time by CofC folks tell the story as it\\nunfolds.  New ideas came into the CofC.  There was a big push to reach out to\\ncollege students, young adults, and teens.  Some called this the Campus \\nEvangel-\\nism Movement.  Emotions, generally not highly regarded in the CofC at large,\\nplayed a more important role in the new movement.  In some places, people \\nbegan\\nto speak in tongues (as their Pentecostal predecessors did).\\n\\tThis was met with extreme criticism from within the Churches of \\nChrist.\\nIn some places, people were fired from their jobs for speaking in tongues or \\nfor\\nadvocating the \"Holy Spirit Movement\", another name for the new branch.  The\\nterm \"Underground Church of Christ\" also came into use because these people \\nhad\\nto hide their differences (or they might be ostricised).\\n\\tThere were several congregations, however, whose leaderships were\\nreceptive to the new ideas (at least in part; the tongues-speaking never \\nreally\\ncaught on).  One of these was the 14th Street Church of Christ in Gainesville,\\nFL.  Campus Ministry had already been regarded as important at 14th Street, \\nand\\nthe new ideas seemed to be very helpful tools for evangelism.  They also \\nseemed\\nto put vitality into the church, which many felt had been lacking.\\n\\tIn October of 1967, the 14th Street congregation hired Chuck Lucas to\\nbe its Campus Minister.  By 1970, he would move to being the congregation\\'s\\n(lead) Minister.  In the late 60\\'s/early 70\\'s, the congregation worked with \\nmany\\nother groups.  They held Bible discussions at Daytona Beach during Spring \\nBreak.\\nThey organized talks in the fraternities on the University of Florida campus.\\nThey also worked with UF sports people.\\n\\tIn 1972, the congregation ordered a larger building to be constructed.\\nWhen it was finished, the group moved and changed its name (now no longer\\nappropriate).  It became the Crossroads Church of Christ from then on, a name\\nthat would become legendary.\\n\\n\\tBy this time, Crossroads was basically the only CofC whose programs\\nwere fully aligned to the new movement.  While they didn\\'t start it, they \\ncontinued it and were responsible for where it wound up going.\\n\\tBy 1975, none of the other Churches of Christ in the area felt that\\nthey could cooperate with Crossroads, due to what they recognized as doctrinal\\nproblems at Crossroads.\\n\\tCrossroads had begun to heavily emphasize, and later require \\nattendance\\nat all church functions.  It was seen as a good thing for each member to have\\nat least one close relationship, a person with whom you would share all of\\nyour problems, pray, and get help from.  The concept was called Prayer \\nPartners,\\nwhich later became Discipleship Partners and also later became mandatory.  The\\nleadership was assigning prayer partners to people for a while.\\n\\tThe book called \"The Master Plan of Evangelism\" was a strong influence\\non Chuck Lucas.  He (and the group) believed that it was every person\\'s duty\\nand life purpose to carry out the great commission.  Crossroads was growing\\nin number, and numbers became VERY important (some would say all-important).\\n\\tA person who \"was evangelistic\" was \"spiritual\".  Evangelism meant\\ninviting people to Crossroads events; if you did this a lot and some of them\\nconverted, then you were \"spiritual\".  There were sermons about how if you\\nbought groceries, the cashier and bag boy ought to receive invitations to\\nservices.  Everyone at your job ought to receive invitations.  Since these\\npeople needed Jesus, you should be \"aggressive\"--don\\'t take \\'no\\' for an\\nanswer.\\n\\tIf you did not evangelize enough, you came to be called \"lazy\" or\\n\"unspiritual\".\\n\\tBy the end of the decade, the Prayer Partner system was integrated \\ninto\\na structure.  The Elders and Ministers were on top (like a big pyramid).  Then\\nthe group leaders, Bible study leaders, and members.  Everyone who came in had\\nsomeone placed over them.\\n\\tIt is at this time, 1978-1980, that the bad press about Crossroads\\nbegan to circulate.  The problem with rape on the University of Florida campus\\nwas tremendous, but Crossroads was considered a bigger and more immediate\\nproblem.  There were many complaints about the congregation and its \"pushy\"\\nevangelistic tactics.  Crossroads was considering the other Churches of Christ\\nto be \"dead\" churches, which aggravated them; it was aggressively recruiting\\nout of the other church groups (denominations), which aggravated THEM.\\n\\n\\tBy this time, Crossroads had grown numerically to the point (1100)\\nwhere not only did they believe that they would soon need a new building, but\\nalso they were sending out \"planting\" [create a new church] and \\n\"reconstructing\"\\n[reorganize an existing church] teams to other cities.  By this time, the\\nCrossroads Movement was underway.\\n\\tA group was sent to the 30-member Lexington Church of Christ in \\nBoston,\\nMA.  The team was headed up by Kip McKean, who had been converted out of a\\nfraternity by Crossroads (in Gainesville).  Kip held a still stronger view of\\nchurch authority, which he believed was heavily vested in the Evangelist(s),\\nand not so much in the Elders.  He had been fired in 1977 from the \\ncongregation\\nthat he had been working at when the elders there found numerous things wrong\\nwith his theology, including the practice of what came to be called one-over-\\none\\nChristianity.  [Called this by critics]\\n\\tIn the first year, half of the 30 people felt that they did not want \\nto\\nbe a part of the new congregation.  They left.  But others began coming into\\nthe new Boston Church of Christ.\\n\\tAh, but I\\'m ahead of myself.\\n\\tAt Crossroads, the heavy-handed system had begun to take its toll on\\nthe members.  Many have said that they felt that they were working hard, but\\nthey were not achieving the results that were so important.  The numbers were\\ndropping.  From 1978, Crossroads membership declined steadily.  The leadership\\nbegan to tighten the reigns on the congregation, who was seen as being largely\\n\"unproductive\" and \"unfruitful\".  The \"fruit\" passages in the NT were \\ninterpreted\\nas referring to new converts.  If you were not bearing fruit, said John 15, \\nyou\\nwould be cast into the fire!  [Boston still teaches this.]\\n\\tIf you love your neighbor, you\\'ll save his soul (invite him to church\\nand convert him).  If you\\'re not doing that, you don\\'t love your neighbor.\\nAnd if you don\\'t love, you\\'re in danger of backsliding.  The logical arguments\\ncontinue in this vein.\\n\\tIn 1985, Chuck Lucas was fired from his job as minister, due to \\nrecurring\\nsins in his life.  These struggles were never revealed to the congregation at\\nlarge, although many people outside the congregation had heard about them.  \\nFor\\nby now, there was very little contact (on a friendship level) between most\\nCrossroads members and those outside.  [If you have contact, your focus should\\nbe on converting them.  Bring them to a Bible Study.]\\n\\tChuck\\'s replacement was Joe Woods, who was fully supportive of the\\nBoston system.  As Boston grew in number, they began to offer \\'training\\' \\nsessions\\nfor other ministers.  Joe went to Boston to be trained and returned to Cross-\\nroads ready to emphasize the \"total commitment\" to the church that Boston and\\nKip McKean were now emphasizing.  Eventually, in Fall of 1987, the Elders at \\nCrossroads (now 2 in number--Dick Whitehead and Bill Hogle) made a decision.\\nBoston was demanding that all of the other churches in the movement come under\\nthe direction of the church in Boston.  The Elders refused, citing their \\nbelief\\nthat each church should be autonomous (something true in all non-Boston \\nChurches\\nof Christ).  Perhaps there was also some degree of offense done here, since\\nCrossroads was no longer the \\'example\\' to the rest of the Movement.  The group\\nnow numbered about 800, while Boston was now larger (in membership).\\n\\tThe Churches of Christ generally teach that baptism is a necessary\\nelement of salvation.  At Crossroads, they taught what was called \\'Lordship\\'\\nbaptism:  you had to understand the commitment involved before you could be\\nbaptized.  You had to \\'count the cost\\'.  At Boston, they took this a step\\nfurther.  If at some time you became \"unproductive\", then your spirituality\\nwas suspect.  People would begin to ask you if you REALLY understood what you\\nwere getting into.  Anyone who said \\'no\\' had their baptism deemed invalid:  \\nthey\\nhadn\\'t counted the cost properly.  They still had to be baptized.  Others \\ncalled\\nthis \"rebaptism\", and Crossroads didn\\'t approve of this practice.\\n\\tWhen Crossroads announced that it would not follow Boston, many of its\\nmembers left Crossroads and went to Movement-related ministries, which were\\nnow called Discipling Ministries.  You were either discipling (evangelizing) \\nor\\nyou were \"dead\".  They also used the nickname \"Movement of God\" for a while.\\n\\tBy Summer of 1988, Crossroads was withdrawn from the Movement and now\\nstood alone.  They had few to no allies in the mainstream Churches of Christ,\\nand now none in the Movement.\\n\\n\\tBoston, however, continued to chart its course in the direction that\\nthey had been following.  They sent \"reconstruction teams\" to many cities, \\nwhich\\nusually meant that they split the church there.  They stopped acknowledging \\nother\\nchurches of Christ as Christians and began to call themselves the \"remnant\".\\nThe \"remnant\" of the Jews in the OT are those who are saved by God.  It was\\nfelt that the \"remnant\" today represents all the Christians.  Sometimes they\\nwould simply call their Movement \"the church\".\\n\\tThey usually took the name of the city for their name, implying to the\\nother Churches of Christ that Boston did not recognize their existence.  Many\\ncampuses have now formally forbidden Boston ministries from recruiting there\\ndue to the number of complaints.  In some cases, it has been documented that\\nBoston ministries have lied to University officials in order to continue to \\nhave\\naccess to the campus.  Any resistance that they experience is termed \"perse-\\ncution\", which all true Christians are expected to experience.  Are you really\\na Christian if you\\'re not being persecuted?\\n\\tThe numbers at Boston peaked at c.3000 in 1989.  Since then, they have\\nfought to remain steady.  I have heard a tape of Kip McKean shouting at the\\nleaders for failing to fulfill the Great Commission (their life\\'s purpose) as\\nGod commanded them.  Their Christianity is highly centered on commands and\\nobedience.\\n\\n\\tCrossroads once was called a cult.  Boston is now recognized by the\\nCult Awareness Network and other national and international groups as a cult,\\nunder a formal definition, because of the techniques which they employ.  The\\nterm \"cult\" is usually differentiated from \"sect\" by the practice of those\\ntechniques.  The techniques which they employ are recognized by many as being\\ntechniques of destructive pursuasion, also used by other Shepherding\\nDiscipleship groups.  [Robert Jay Lifton, Margaret Thaler Singer, and many\\nothers have written about the topic.]  These techniques include guilt \\nmotivation,\\nemotional manipulation, loaded language, the aura of sacred science (a sort\\nof mystic element seen in everyday events), and others.\\n\\n\\tI have no particular axe to grind against the Movement.  I have numer-\\nous friends who are still part of the Movement.  I have never had a \\'falling\\nout\\' with anyone in the Movement.  I disagree with many things which they \\nteach.\\nI recognize the psychological damage done by being involved in such a system.\\nI hold no loyalty to the mainstream Churches of Christ and do not defend their\\nmistakes either.\\n\\tI want to point out, though, that unlike in many other systems which\\nare in other ways similar, the Leadership of the Boston Movement are as much\\nvictims of the system as the members.  We do not have a leader who enjoys\\nmanipulating his people.  The leaders believe what they teach, and they feel\\naccountable for the activites (and spiritual welfare) of the members.  When\\nmembers do not evangelize to their expectations, for example, the leaders feel\\npersonally responsible as well.  The leaders are not out for money or power.\\nThey want to evangelize the world in their lifetime.\\n\\n\\tI have said too much, but there is much more to say.  There are many\\nexamples I could give and quotes from other sources (including Boston \\nbulletins)\\nthat I could include.  But this is too long already.

            "'From: ldo@waikato.ac.nz (Lawrence D\\'Oliveiro, Waikato University)\\nSubject: QuickTime performance (was Re: Rumours about 3DO ???)\\nOrganization: University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand\\nLines: 67\\n\\nOK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime,\\nthe effects of scaling and so on, I thought I\\'d do some more tests.\\n\\nFirst of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than\\nrealistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\\nversion of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\\nI decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\\n(for better or for worse).\\n\\nI pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\\na while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\nthe Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\\na portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\nstation. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\nframes. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\\n5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\nI captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\\ncard in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\\nimported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\\nkeeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\nto 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\\n\"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\nframes.\\n\\nI then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\\nfor the results I\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\nResult: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\nThat\\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\ntest movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\ndisk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\\nwas only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\\n(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\nI modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\nscaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\nsize. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\\nobserved poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\\naction, not 1.5. I\\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\\'t think it\\'s\\nentirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\\n\\nUnscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\nThe other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n\"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\nfrom within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\\'s normal synchronized playback).\\nA preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was\\nvery jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\\nease. I can\\'t believe that QuickTime\\'s synchronization code would add this\\nmuch overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\\'s task\\nswitching.\\n\\nA preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\\'t see\\nany evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\\nstutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\\n\\nI guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\\nkey frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\\nimprove the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\\neven more...\\n\\nLawrence D\\'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889\\nComputer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066\\nUniversity of Waikato            electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz\\nHamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47\\' 26\" S, 175^ 19\\' 7\" E, GMT+12:00\\n' ------------> comp.graphics\n",

Here is \\neverything that you would ever want to know about PMS.\\n\\nPremenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups:\\n\\n\\tPMT-A(Anxiety)\\t\\tPMT-D(depression)\\n\\tanxiety\\t\\t\\tdepression\\n\\tirritability\\t\\tforgetfulness\\n\\tinsomnia\\t\\tconfusion\\n\\tdepression\\t\\tlethargy\\n\\n\\tPMT-C(Craving)\\t\\tPMT-H(Hyperhydration)\\n\\tcraving for sweets\\tweight gain\\n\\tincreased appetite\\tbreast congestion and tenderness\\n\\tsugar ingestion causes: abdominal bloating and tenderness\\n\\t 1. headache\\t\\tedema of the face and extremities\\n\\t 2. palpitations\\n\\t 3. fatigue or fainting\\n \\nPMT-A is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low \\nprogesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women\\'s cycle.\\n\\nPMT-C is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple \\ncarbohydrates.  During the luteal phase of a women\\'s cycle, there is \\nincreased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose \\nchallenge.  The metabolic findings believed to be responsible for PMT-C are \\na low magnesium and a low prostaglandin E1.  This condition of hypoglycemia \\nis not unique to PMS but there are a number of different causes of \\nhypoglycemia, magnesium and PGE1 seem to be specific to PMS hypoglycemia.\\n\\tA. Am. J. Psychiatry 147(4):477-80(1990).\\nUnrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar, magnesium \\nsupplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation(increased to 5-6% of \\nthe total calories) using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources \\nof alpha linoleic acid.\\n\\nPMT-D is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal \\nphase of a women\\'s cycle.  Another cause of PMT-D has been found to be lead \\ntoxicity(in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal \\nphase). \"Effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human \\nendometrial cystol\" Fertil. Steril. 28:312-18(1972).\\n\\nPMT-H is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated \\nserum aldosterone level.  Salt restriction, B6, magnesium and vitamin E \\nfor breast tenderness have all been effective in treating PMT-H\\n\\nThis general discussion of the PMS syndromes came form:\\n\\n\\tA. \"Management of the premenstrual tension sundromes: Rational for \\n\\t    a nutritional approach\". 1986, A Year in Nutritional Medicine. \\n\\t    J. Bland, Ed. Keats, Publishing, 1986.\\n\\n\\tB. \"Nutritional factors in the etiology of premenstrual tension \\n\\t    syndromes\", J. Reprod. Med.28(7):446-64(1983).\\n\\n\\tC. \"Premenstrual tension\", Prob. Obstet. Gynecol. 3(12):1-39(1980)\\n\\nTreatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can \\nfind a doctor who will treat you for PMS(just about as hard as finding one \\nthat will treat you for candida blooms).  While progesterone will work, \\nsupplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better.  There really \\nhas been an awful lot of research done on PMS(much more than candida \\nblooms).  Many of these studies have been what are called experimental \\ncontrolled studies(the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to \\nsee done).\\n\\nHere are a few of these studies:\\n\\n\\tCARBOHYDRATE: Experimental Controlled Study, \"Effect of a low-fat, \\n\\thigh-carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy\" Lancet \\n\\t2:128-32(1988).  21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy \\n\\tof at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive \\n\\tspecific training to reduce dietary fat to 15% of total calories \\n\\tand increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary \\n\\tadvise with no training.  After 6 months, there was a significant \\n\\treduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in \\n\\tthe trained group as reported by self-reported symptoms as well as \\n\\tphysical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling, \\n\\ttenderness and nodularity.\\n\\n\\tVITAMIN A: Experimental Controlled Study, \"The use of Vitamin A in \\n\\tpremenstrual tension\" Acta Obstet. Gynecol Scand. 39:586-92(1960).  \\n\\t218 pts with severe recurring PMS received 200,000 to 300,000IU \\n\\tvitamin A daily or a placebo.  Serum retinol levels were monitored \\n\\tand high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of \\n\\ttoxicity occured(serum retinol above 450ug/ml).  The intent of the \\n\\tstudy was to load the liver up with vitamin A and get a normal pool \\n\\tsize(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU) and then see if this \\n\\tnormal vitamin A pool could prevent PMS.  48% getting the high dose \\n\\tvitamin A had complete remission of the symptoms of PMS.  Only 10% \\n\\tgetting the placebo reported getting complete relief of PMS sysmptoms.\\n  \\t10% of the vitamin A treated group reported no improvement in PMS \\n\\tsymptoms.\\n\\n\\tExperimental Controlled Study, \"Premenstrual tension treated with \\n\\tvitamin A\" J. Clinical Endocrinology 10:1579-89(1950). 30 pts \\n\\treceived 200,000IU of vitamin A daily starting on day 15 of their \\n\\tcycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of PMS symptoms.\\n  \\tAfter 2-6 months, all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in \\n\\tPMS symptoms.  Vitamin A supplementation was stopped once evidence of \\n\\ttoxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year \\n\\tafter high dose vitamin A supplementation was stopped.  PMS symptoms \\n\\tdid not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the \\n\\tvitamin A supplementation was stopped.\\n\\nMost Americans do not have a normal store of vitamin A in their liver.  \\nThese studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal \\nstore of vitamin A into the liver could eliminate PMS.  Of all the vitamins \\ngiven for PMS(vitamin A, B6, and vitamin E), vitamin A has shown the best \\nsingle effect.  This is probably because vitamin A is involved in steroid \\n(estrogen/progesterone) metabolism in the liver.  Getting your liver full \\nof vitamin A seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent \\nthe symptoms of PMS.  But vitamin A is toxic and you don\\'t want to be trying \\nto do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin \\nA toxicity.\\n\\n\\tVITAMIN B6: Experimental Double-blind Crossoverr Study, \"Pyridoxine\\n\\t(vitamin B6) and the premenstrual syndrome: A randomized crossover \\n\\ttrial\"J.R. Coll. Gen. Pract. 39:364-68(1989).  32 women aged 18-49 \\n\\twith moderate to severe PMS randomly received 50mg B6 daily or placebo.\\n  \\tAfter 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another \\n\\t3 months.  B6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of \\n\\tPMS(depression, irritability and tiredness).  Other symptoms of PMS \\n\\twere not significanttly affected by B6 supplementation.\\n\\n\\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"The efects of vitamin B6 \\n\\tsupplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms\" Obstet. Gynecol \\n\\t70(2):145-49(1987).  55 pts with moderate to severe PMS received \\n\\t150mg B6 daily or placebo for 2 months.  Analysis of convergence \\n\\tshowed that B6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related \\n\\tto the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as \\n\\tbehavior changes(poor mental performance, decreased social interaction)\\n  \\tAnxiety, depression and water retention were not improved by B6 \\n\\tsupplementation.\\n\\nVitamin B6 is below the RDA for both American men and women.  Birth control \\npills and over 40 different drugs increase the B6 requirement in man.  \\nWomen on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10-15 mg of B6 per \\nday.  The dose should be increased if symptoms of PMS appear.  Dr. David R. \\nRubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of NIMH was quoted in \\nClin. Psychiatry News, December, 1987 as stating that B6 should be \\nconsidered the \"first-line\" drug for PMS(over progesterone) and if the \\npatient does not respond, then other treatments should be tried.  Vitamin \\nB6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each \\nday. \\n\\n\\n\\tVITAMIN E: Experimental Double-blind Study, \"Efficacy of alpha-\\n\\ttocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome\" J. Reprod. \\n\\tMed. 32(6):400-04(1987). 35 pts received 400IU vitamin E daily for 3 \\n\\tcycles or a placebo.  Vitamin E treated pts had 33% who reported a \\n\\tsignificant reduction in physical symptoms(weight gain and breast \\n\\ttenderness) while the placebo group had 14% who reported a significant\\n \\treduction in physical symptoms. The vitamin E group reported that 38% \\n\\thad a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12% for the placebo \\n\\tgroup.  For depression, the vitamin E group had 27% with a significant\\n\\tdecrease in depression compared with 8% for the placebo group.\\n\\n\\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"The effect of alpha-tocopherol on \\n\\tpremenstrual symptomalogy: A double blind study\" J. Am. Coll. Nutr. \\n\\t2(2):115-122(1983). 75pts with benign breast disease and PMT randomly \\n\\treceived vitamin E at 75IU, 150IU, or 300IU daily or placebo.  After \\n\\t2 months of supplementation, 150IU of vitamin E or higher significantly \\n\\timproved PMT-A and PMT-C.  The 300IU dose was needed to significantly \\n\\timprove PMT-D.  No dose of vitamin E significantly improved PMT-H\\n\\t(other studies have shown that a higher vitamin E doses will relieve \\n\\tPMT-H symptoms).\\n\\t\\n\\tMAGNESIUM: Experimental Double-blind Study, \"Magnesium prophylaxis \\n\\tof menstrual migraine: effects on itracellular magnesium\" Headache \\n\\t31:298-304(1991). 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg \\n\\tdaily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a \\n\\tplacebo.  Treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and \\n\\tcontinued until menstruation. After 2 months, the Pain Total Index \\n\\twas significantly lower in the magnesium group.  Magnesium treatment \\n\\twas also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the Menstrual \\n\\tDistress Questionnaire scores.  Pretreatment magnesium levels in  \\n\\tlymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower \\n\\tin this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer \\n\\tfrom PMS.  After treatment, magnesium levels in these cells was raised \\n\\tinto the normal range.\\n\\n\\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"Oral Magnesium successfully \\n\\trelieves premenstrual mood changes\" Obstet. Gynecol 78(2):177-81(1991). \\n\\t32pts aged 24-39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid \\n\\t360mg of Mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the \\n\\tonset of the menstrual flow.  After 2 cycles, both groups received \\n\\tmagnesium.  The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster \\n\\tpain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the \\n\\tmagnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were \\n\\tswitched to magnesium supplementation.  In addition, the total score on \\n\\tthe Menstrual Distress Questionnaire was significantly decreased by \\n\\tmagnesium supplementation.  The authors suggest that magnesium \\n\\tsupplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes \\n\\tthat occur during PMS.\\n\\nThere are numerous observational studies that have been published in the \\nmedical literature which also suggest that PMS is primarily a disorder \\nthat arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature.  But \\nsince observational studies are considered by most physicians in Sci. Med. \\nto be anecdotal in nature, I have not bothered to cite them.  There are \\nalso over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on \\nmultivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent PMS.  I\\'ve chosen the \\nbest specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out \\nthat PMS is primarily a nutritional disorder.  But doctors don\\'t recognize \\nnutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology(beri-beri, \\npellagra, scruvy, etc.).  PMS is probably the best reason why every doctor \\nbeing trained in the U.S. should get a good course on human nutrition.  PMS \\nis really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional \\ndisorders.  It\\'s time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses.\\n\\nHere\\'s some studies which show the importance in multivitamin/mineral \\nsupplementation and/or diet change in preventing PMS.\\n\\n\\tExperimental Study, \"Effect of a nutritional programme on \\n\\tpremenstrual syndrome: a retrospective analysis\", Complement. Med. \\n\\tRes.5(1):8-11(1991).  200pts were given dietary instructions and \\n\\tsupplemented with Optivite(R) plus additional vitamin C, vitamin E, \\n\\tmagnesium, zinc and primrose oil.  The dietary instructions were to \\n\\ttake the supplements and switch to a low fat, complex carbohydrate \\n\\tdiet.  On a retrospective analysis, 96.5% of the 200pts reported an \\n\\timprovement in their PMS symptoms with 30% of the sample stating that \\n\\tthey no longer suffered from PMS. \\n\\n\\n\\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"Role of Nutrition in managing \\n\\tpremenstrual tension syndromes\", J Reprod. Med. 32(6):405-22(1987).  \\n\\tA low fat, high complex carbohydrate diet along with Optivite \\n\\tsupplementation significantly decreased PMS scores compared with diet \\n\\tchange and placebo.  After 6 months on the experimental program, the \\n\\tvitamin/mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased \\n\\testradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel \\n\\tphase of their cycle.\\n\\n\\tExperimental Double-blind Study, \"Clinical and biochemical effects \\n\\tof nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome\", J. \\n\\tReprod. Med. 32(6):435-41(1987). 119pts randomly given Optivite(12 \\n\\ttablets per day) or a placebo.  The treated groups showed a \\n\\tsignificant decrease in PMS symptoms compared to the placebo.  Another\\n \\tgroup of 104pts got Optivite(4 tablets per day) or placebo.  For this \\n\\tsecond group of patients, no significant effect of supplementation on \\n\\tPMS symptoms was observed.\\n\\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\\n1111 W. 17th St.\\nTulsa, Ok 74107\\n\\n\"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is \\nno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance\" \\n' ------------> sci.med\n",

But before I do, I want to \\nget a few things off my chest.  I just got blasted in e-mail for my kidney \\nstone posts.  Kidney stones are primarily caused by diet, as is heart \\ndisease and cancer.  When I give dietary advise, it is not intended to \\nencourage people reading this news group(or Sci. Med. Nutrition where I do \\nmost of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor.  Nothing can be further from \\nthe truth.  Kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to \\nbe ruled out.  But once it is, diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance.\\nSame thing with heart disease and cancer, if you suspect that you may have \\na problem with one of these diseases, don\\'t use what I\\'m going to tell you \\nor what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor.  You have to go.\\nHopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help \\nyou change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment \\nprogram(but the odds are that you will not and that\\'s why I\\'m here).  When \\nmy wife detected a lump in here breast I didn\\'t say, don\\'t worry my vitamin \\nE will take care of it.  Any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician, \\nplan and simple.  If it\\'s begnin(which most are) fine, then maybe a diet \\nchange and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring.\\nBut let me tell you right now, if you have tried diet and supplementation \\nand another lump returns, get your butt into the doctor\\'s office as fast as \\nyour little feet can carry you(better yet, have a mammography done on a \\nregular basis, my wife kept putting her\\'s off, both myself and her \\ngynocologist told her she needed to have one done).  Her gynocologist even \\nscheduled one, but she didn\\'t show up(too busy running the Operating Room for \\nthe biggest Hospital in Tulsa).\\n\\nOne more thing, I am not an orthomolecular nutritionist.  This group uses \\nhigh dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease.  There is \\nabsolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have \\ndrug actions in the body.  But you talk about flying blind, man this is \\nreally blind treatment.  No drug could ever be used as these vitamins and \\nminerals are being used.  I\\'m not saying that some of this stuff couldn\\'t \\nbe right on the money, it may well be.  But my approach to nutrition is a \\nlot like that of Weinsier and Morgan, the two M.D\\'s who wrote the new \\nClinical Nutrition textbook.  My push is the nutrient reserves and the lab \\ntests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet \\nchanges to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you \\nhandle stress.  That\\'s where I\\'m coming from folks.  Blast away if you want,\\nI\\'m not going to change.  Put me in your killfile if you want, I really \\ndon\\'t care.  I\\'m averaging 8-10 e-mail messages a day from people who think \\nthat I\\'ve got something important to say.  But I\\'m also getting hit by a \\nfew with an axe to grind.  That\\'s life.\\n\\nChromium is one of the trace elements.  It has a very limited(but very \\nimportant) role in the body.  It is used to form glucose tolerance factor\\n(GTF).  GTF is made up of chromium, nicinamide(niacin), glycine, cysteine \\nand glutamic.  Only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to \\nform GTF.  Some foods already have GTF(Liver, brewers or nutritional yeast,\\nand black pepper).  When chromium is in GTF, a pretty good absorption is \\nseen(about 20%).  But when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral \\nchelate(chromium picolinate) it\\'s absorption is much lower(1 to 2%, lowest \\nfor all the minerals).  I\\'ve been posting in Misc. Fitness and chromium has \\ncome up there several times as a \"fat burner\".  Chromium is among the least \\ntoxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really \\ndo any harm.  I wouldn\\'t do it though.  The adequate and safe range for \\nchromium is 50 to 200ug per day.  The average American is getting about \\n30ug per day from his/her diet.  Chromium levels decrease with age and many \\nbelieve that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency.  I \\ncan cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in \\nType II diabetes but I\\'m not going to because for each positive one, there \\nalso seems to be a negative one as well.  I\\'m convinced that the problem is \\nbioavailability.  When yeast(GTF) is used, good results are obtained but when \\nchromium itself is used the results are usually negative.  In addition to \\nType II diabetes, chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and \\nglucoma, again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is \\nconcerned\\n\\nSince a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease, \\nthis possible link with chromium isn\\'t too surprising.  Glucoma is a little \\nmore interesting.  Muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin \\nresponsive glucose-driven metabolic function.  If this eye focusing activity \\nis impaired(by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response), intraocular \\npressure is believed to be elevated.  In a fairly large study of 400 pts with \\nglaucoma, the one consistent finding was a low RBC chromium. J. Am. Coll. \\nNutr. 10(5):536,(1991).  But this one preliminary study should not prompt \\npeople to go out and start popping chromium supplements.  For one thing, \\njust about every older person is going to have a low RBC chromium unless \\nthey have been taking chromium suppleemnts(yeast).  Since glucoma is often \\nfound in older people, it\\'s not too surprising that chromium was low in the \\nRBC\\'s.  If chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma, that would \\nprompt some attention.  I suspect that there will be a clinical trail to \\ncheck out this possible chromium link to glucoma.\\n\\nYou could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the RBC \\nchromium test or hair analysis.  Most clinical labs are not going to run a \\nRBC chromium.  There are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail \\nanalysis for you, but I wouldn\\'t use them.  There is just too much funny \\nbusiness going on in these unregulated labs right now.\\n\\nHere\\'s Weinsier and Morgan, advise on chromium.  They do not consider \\nchromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is \\navailable(they don\\'t like the hair and nail analysis labs either, and they \\nalso recognize the RBC chromium is primarily a research test that is not \\nroutinely available in most clinical chemistry labs).  This has to change \\nand as more labs run a RBC chromiuum, it will.  What then do they suggest?\\nMake a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical \\nresponse to chromium(run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium \\nsupplementation).  Once you make the diagnosis, put the patient on 200ug of \\nCrCl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day.\\n\\nWhat\\'s my advise?  Don\\'t take chromium supplements to try to loose weight\\n(they just do not work that way).  If you want to take them and then \\nexercise, that would be great.  Do include yeast as part of your diet(most \\nAmericans are not getting enough chromium from their diet).  If you do have \\na poor glucose tolerance, ask your doctor to check your chromium status.  \\nWhen he or she says, \"what in the world are you talking about\", just say, \\nplease get a copy of Weinsier and Morgan\\'s new Clinical Nutrition textbook \\nand do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose \\ntolerance.  If you can\\'t do that, I\\'ll find a doctor who can, thank you \\nvery much.\\n\\nMarty B.\\n' ------------> sci.med\n",

Chronic *persistant* hepatitis simply means that\\n>the patient has HbSag in his/her blood and can transmit the infection, but\\n>shows no evidence of progressive disease.  If I had to choose, I\\'d much\\n>rather have the persistant type.\\n\\n\\nBeing a chronic HBsAg carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chronic\\npersistent anything. Persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical,\\nbiochemical, or histologic evidence of liver disease, or they may have chronic\\npersistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular\\ncarcinoma.\\n\\nMost cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH) are probably the result of\\na viral infection, although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be\\ndetermined. The diagnosis of CPH is made on the basis of liver biopsy. It\\nconsists of findings of portal inflammation, an intact periportal limiting\\nplate, and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. But in contrast\\nto chronic active hepatitis (CAH) there is no periportal inflammation, \\nbridging necrosis, or fibrosis. \\n\\nCPH has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. If I had to choose between CAH and\\nCPH there is no question I would also choose CPH. However, as David pointed\\nout, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have\\nit. The histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal, with biopsies showing\\nareas compatible with both CPH and CAH. Maybe it is a sampling problem. Maybe\\nit is a continuum. I don\\'t know.\\n\\n=================================\\n\\nHoward Doyle\\ndoyle+@pitt.edu\\n\\n\\n' ------------> sci.med\n",

A single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater\\ncan cause hepatotoxicity, and doses of 25 grams or more are\\npotentially fatal from hepatic necrosis.  If I recall\\ncorrectly, the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses\\ninvolves N-hydroxylation to N-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine, which\\nis a highly reactive intermediate, which then reacts with\\nsulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione.  When hepatic\\nglutathione is used up, this intermediate then starts\\nattacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic\\nnecrosis.  The insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the\\ndelay (2-4 days) between ingestion and clinical signs of liver\\ndamage.  This is NOT a nice way to die.\\n\\nAs to taking 20-30 of these tablets, that comes to 5-7.5 grams\\nof acetaminophen.

The founder of this\\nmovement, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to \\nbe the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in the Scriptures\\nof almost all major religions of the world. He claimed to be the \\nfulfillment of the long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ\\n(metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.\\n\\n        The claims of Hazrat Ahmad raised storms of hostility and\\nextreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of \\ndivine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted especial-\\nly in some of the Muslim regimes. The right of Ahmadi Muslims to \\nopenly practice their religion and to define themselves as Muslims\\nhas been severely restricted in many Muslim Countries. The United\\nNations, human rights organizations such as Amnesty International\\nand top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns \\nagainst this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the\\nmembers of this movement, but so far to no avail.\\n\\n        Despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont-\\ninues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the\\nworld in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul-\\ntural backgrounds.\\n\\n        The movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards\\ndeveloping a better understanding of all religions. Ahmadi Muslims\\nhave always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli-\\ngious intolerance and fundamentalism.\\n\\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\\ntablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinics\\nin many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by\\nvolunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement\\'s\\ninternal resources. The movement stresses the importance of educa-\\ntion and leadership. Its members have included a high number of\\nprofessionals as well as world class individuals.\\n\\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\\nreform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\\none universal brotherhood.\\n\\n\\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \\n==================\\n\\n        The  discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi-\\ncially ended. Voting will be held for three weeks. If the news-\\ngroup gets 2/3rd majority AND 100 more \"YES/Create\" votes than\\n\"NO/don\\'t create\" votes; the newsgroup shall be created. \\n\\n\\nABOUT THE VOTE-TAKER: \\n====================\\n\\n        Mr. Anthony Lest has been asked by the proponents of\\nthis newsgroup to act as an official impartial vote-taker for the\\nproposed newsgroup. He has no objection to  use his workstation\\nfor the purpose of vote-taking. Neither the University of Colora-\\ndo, nor Anthony Lest has anything to do with the proposal of the\\nnewsgroup.

She said\\nthat when she and my father were raising we four children, they\\ndid not try to raise us in this world as strictly as they were raised\\nin their Norwegian Lutheran community. They felt that we would be\\nalienated from them and it would create problems.\\n  In other words, my parent did the very tolerant, loving thing. They\\nraised us without conflict, without what we saw as unreasonable\\ndemands and were always accepting, no matter what the circumstances.\\n  What happened was that I grew up believing in situation ethics and\\nnever absolutes. I believed in a loving God, and my concept of God\\nnever involved justice or punishment, nor was there any concept that\\nI may someday be held responsible for the things that offended\\nHim...sins that the \"world\" told me were OK.\\n  My parents are very good, honest and moral people. They raised\\nfour extremely honest children. Yet, before coming to a more\\ncomplete knowledge of God (which includes the knowledge of justice\\nand punishment)I committed what I now believe to be many, many\\ngrave sins. I lived with a partner outside of marriage, was married\\nand divorced ( only after physical abuse and no apparent hope for\\nchange...but I shouldn\\'t have married to person in the first place )\\nand more....\\n  My parents felt they were doing the loving,kind thing by allowing\\nus to be who we were, by not imposing their standards on us, and by\\naccepting unquestioningly everything we did without judgement or\\ncounsel.\\n  Today, it is absolutely appalling for me to look back on what they\\n*did* accept without a word. It takes courages to dare to help souls\\nbecause you must speak up and say what is unpopular and\\ndifficult and what people do not want to hear. You must be able\\nto say what is hard, and say it as Christ would, with love and\\ncompassion. It involves risk....perhaps someone you love may not\\nwant to hear and will stay away from you.\\n  This life is \"but dust\". As long as the comfort of this life\\nis our highest priority, we will fail God and fail those\\nwith whom we come in contact.\\n  I wonder how many who engage in sex outside of marriage, who\\nsupport the \"right\" to abortion, who engage in homosexuality,\\nor who commit any of the range of sins that are plentiful in\\nthis time have ever heard from a quiet, thoughtful, loving\\nfriend that these things are *wrong*. No one ever told me that\\nwhat I was doing was wrong, and I saw multitudes around me\\nliving the same way I was and they seemed like good, decent\\npeople. (wouldn\\'t kick dogs or beat the elderly or babies..)\\nIt is more difficult for sinners without a genuine prayer\\nlife to hear the Holy Spirit than it is to hear a loving friend.\\nThink about this the next time the Holy Spirit tells you that\\na friend is in error, but you don\\'t want to \"cause trouble\".\\nRighteous prayers is great power, but don\\'t forget that we are\\nwe are Christ\\'s lips and hands on earth. Don\\'t be afraid to\\nsimply voice Truth when the situation calls for it.

The LightWave software (LightWave=LightWave3D and\\nLightWave Modeler) allows and artist to create three dimensional\\nphoto-realistic images for a variety of purposes.\\n\\n-- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? --\\n\\nThis mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software, how\\nit operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images\\navailable to them.  The list is for those who own the Toaster and\\nLightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the\\npackage.  We hope to share information, tips, procedures and to bond as\\na group.\\n\\n-- WHAT ARE THE RULES? --\\n\\nSince LightWave/Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster\\nsoftware, I\\'m sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation\\nof the Toaster.  However, we will strive to keep the subject revolving\\nspecifically around the 3D software, related tools and products.\\n\\nYou do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list!\\n\\n-- OK! HOW DO I JOIN? --\\n\\nTo become a member of the LightWave3D mailing list you must send a mail\\nmessage to the address:\\n\\n        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com\\n\\nIn the body of the message enter:\\n\\nsubscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain\\n\\nOr just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list.  At this\\npoint in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated\\nscript based system in place soon.  There shouldn\\'t be too much of a\\ndelay in joining.  Expect a \"welcome\" message within 5 days after you\\nsend your request.  Then, expect the mail to start flowing in!\\n\\n-- HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST? --\\n\\nContributing to the list is simple.  Just mail your articles to the\\nfollowing address:\\n\\n        lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com\\n\\nYour article will be processed by the system and distributed to all\\nothers joined to the list.  Your articles will also be sent to you so\\nyou know that your article has made it to the list.  However, those\\naddresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back\\nto you.  So, if you post an article and another members address is no\\nlonger valid, your original article will be returned to you.  This\\ndoesn\\'t mean it hasn\\'t been posted to the list.  In fact, just the\\nopposite is true. It means that your article WAS posted and that it\\ncouldn\\'t be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad\\naddress.\\n\\nNOTE: I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon.\\n\\n-- HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST? --\\n\\nSimply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address\\nyou used to sign up:\\n\\n        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com\\n\\nIn the body of the message enter:\\n\\nunsubscribe LightWave-l your.name@your.site.domain\\n\\nI will remove your name from the list of members.

If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send\\na request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend\\nforwarding of the articles to you.\\n\\n\\n-- WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES? --\\n\\nI am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the\\noriginating site (bobsbox).

None of his A-1 through A-5\\nantineoplastons have been shown to have antineoplastic effects against\\nexperimental cancer. The NCI conducted tests of A-2 and A-5 against\\nleukemia in mice, with the result that doses high enough to produce\\ntoxic effects in the mice were not effective in inhibiting the growth\\nof the tumor or killing it. (These were in 1983 and 1985)\\n\\nBurzynski claims that A-10 is the active factor common to all of A-1\\nand A-5 (something which he has not shown, A-10 has only been\\nextracted from A-2. He also hasn\\'t shown that A-1 through A-5 are actually\\ndistinct substances). The NCI conducted a series of tests using A-10\\nagainst a standard panel of tumors that included different cell lines\\nfrom tumors in the following classes: leukemia, non-small-cell and\\nsmall-cell lung cancer, colon cancer, cancer of the central nervous\\nsystem, melanoma, ovarian cancer and renal cancer. A-10 exhibited\\nneither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels tested.\\n\\nIt is necessary to process A-10 since it is not soluble (Burzynski\\'s\\ntheory requires soluble agents), but this basically hydrolizes it to\\nPAG (which he calls AS 2.5). PAG is not an information carrying\\npeptide, something which Byrzynski claims is necessary for\\nantineoplastic activity. AS 2.1 (also derived from A-10) is a 4:1\\nmixture of PA and PAG. PA (also not a peptide) can be purchased at a\\nchemical supply houses for about $0.09 a gram. A-10 is chemically\\nextremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide, both of which are\\nhabit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy. The nasty effects\\nof thalidomide are widely known.

But it can be the decisive component\\nof an overall strategy for long-term weight control and make an\\nimportant contribution to good health.  It is important to\\nexercise (11, 12) and also avoid fat calories (9, 10).\\n\\nChromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increase\\nlean muscle (1, 2, 3).  I will not bore you with the\\nstatistics.  You wouldn\\'t believe these anyway.\\n\\nChromium Picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source of\\nthe essential mineral chromium.  Chromium plays a vital role\\nin \"sensitizing\" the body\\'s tissues to the hormone insulin.\\nWeight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivity\\nto insulin and thus, in turn, makes it harder to lose\\nweight (4).\\n\\nInsulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retards\\nprotein breakdown in muscles (5, 6).  This \"protein sparing\"\\neffect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie diets\\nas insulin levels decline, which results in loss of muscle\\nand organ tissue.  By \"sensitizing\" muscle to insulin,\\nchromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieters\\nso that they \"burn\" more fat and less muscle.  Preservation\\nof lean body mass has an important long-term positive\\neffect on metabolic rate, helping dieters keep off the\\nfat they\\'ve lost.\\n\\nChromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aiding\\nthe thermogenic (heat producing) effects of insulin.\\nInsulin levels serve as a rough index of the availability\\nof food calories, so it\\'s not at all surprising that insulin \\nstimulates metabolism (4, 7, 8).  Note that I did not say\\nthat chromium picolinate increases metabolism.\\n\\nIn summary, you need to change your life style in order to\\nloose weight and stay healthy:\\n\\n  A. Reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than 20% of calories.\\n     - Eating fat makes you fat.\\n\\n  B. Increase dietary fiber\\n     - low in calories; high in nutrients.\\n\\n  C. Get regular aerobic exercise at least 3 times a week\\n     - burn calories.\\n\\n  D. Take chromium picolinate daily\\n     - lose fat; keep muscle\\n\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\n1.

I was also\\nshocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by\\nabout 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only\\n1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn\\'t seem so bad.  What\\nis happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due\\nmainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but is\\nmore like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at\\ndifferent x/y values, the \"ridges\" are out of phase, resulting in the\\nstitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon\\nright on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely see\\na smeared effect where they overlap.\\n  Example:\\n  Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)\\n      Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)\\n\\nYour implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick when\\nrendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces\\nwith isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as\\nyou say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the\\nsystem does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the\\napplication must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing.\\nBravo!\\n\\n(Note to IBM\\'ers:  The information given here has been previously disclosed\\nthrough proper channels so I\\'m not giving away any new unpublished info.)\\n\\n-- \\n  Mark Einkauf     [ einkauf@austin.ibm.com ]\\n  IBM - Advanced Workstations and Systems - Graphics Systems\\n  Austin TX\\n * Views and opinions expressed herein are not necessarily those of IBM Corp. *\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

The \"false prophets\" understood their relatioship\\nto God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David. It is\\npossible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant,\\nwhich was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David\\'s\\ndescendants, came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part\\nof the Lord to keep a descendant of David\\'s upon the throne and to never\\nallow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power. Jeremiah was not a\\nJudahite prophet. He was from Anathoth, across the border in what had formerly\\nbeen Israelite territory. When he came to prophesy, he came from the\\ntheological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel\\nthrough Moses. The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant\\nafter the death of Solomon. His theology clashed with the theology of the\\nlocal prophets. It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic\\ncovenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah\\nspoke his prophesies. The \"judgement prophesies\" were deeply loaded with\\ntheological meaning.\\n\\nIn my opinion, both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson\\n\"New York will burn\" prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic\\ntheological depths of the Jeremiah prophesies.\\n\\n--\\n                                                                     ___\\nBill Rea                                                            (o o)\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---\\n| Bill Rea, Computer Services Centre, | E-Mail   b.rea@csc.canterbury.ac.nz |\\n| University of Canterbury,           | or     cctr114@csc.canterbury.ac.nz |\\n| Christchurch, New Zealand           | Phone (03)-642-331 Fax (03)-642-999 |\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

There are other\\nalgorithms, but this one works well and is fairly simple.  Implementations\\nare included in most raster toolkits (see item 7 below).\\n\\nA variant method is described in \"Graphics Gems\", p. 287-293.  Note that\\nthe code from the \"Graphics Gems\" series is all available from an FTP site,\\nas described above.\\n\\nCheck out John Bradley\\'s \"Diversity Algorithm\", which is incorporated into\\nthe xv package and described in the back of the manual.\\n\\nThe ImageMagick package (see section 7 for where it is) contains another\\nquantizing algorithm which is presented as \"doing a better job than the\\nother algorithms, but slower\".\\n\\nThere\\'s also an implementation of:\\n\\nWan, Wong, and Prusinkiewicz, _An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data\\nClustering_, Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. 14 #2 (June, 1988),\\npp. 153-162.\\n\\navialable as princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/colorquant.shar.  This code,\\nin modified form, appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well.\\n\\n\\n4) Converting color into grayscale.\\n\\nThe NTSC formula is:\\n\\n    luminosity = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue\\n\\n\\n5) Quantizing grayscale to black&white.\\n\\nThe only reference you need for this stuff is:\\n\\n    Digital Halftoning, Robert Ulichney, MIT Press 1987, ISBN 0-262-21009-6\\n\\nBut before you go off and start coding, check out the image manipulation\\nsoftware mentioned in item 7 below.  All of the packages mentioned can do\\nsome form of gray to b&w conversion.\\n\\n\\n6) Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle.\\n\\nThe obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source\\nimage, transform each coordinate, and copy the pixel to the destination.\\nThis is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination.  Instead,\\nloop over the pixels in the destination image, apply the *reverse*\\ntransformation to the coordinates, and copy that pixel from the source.\\nThis method is quite general, and can be used for any one-to-one\\n2-D mapping, not just rotation.  You can add anti-aliasing by doing\\nsub-pixel sampling.\\n\\nHowever, there is a much faster method, with antialising included,\\nwhich involves doing three shear operations.  The method was originally\\ncreated for the IM Raster Toolkit (see below); an implementation is\\nalso present in PBMPLUS.  Reference: \"A Fast Algorithm for Raster\\nRotation\", by Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) Graphics\\nInterface \\'86 (Vancouver).  An article on the IM toolkit appears in\\nthe same journal.  An updated version of the rotation paper appears\\nin \"Graphics Gems\" (see section [1]) under the original title.\\n\\n\\n7) Free image manipulation software.\\n\\nThere are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to\\nanother, doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling, plus\\nthe above-mentioned 24 -> 8, color -> gray, gray -> b&w conversions.\\nHere are pointers to some of them:\\n\\n    xv by John Bradley.

See item 13 below for\\ndetails on some.\\n\\nAlso, the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussion\\nof software like this.  You may find useful information there.\\n\\n\\n8) Format documents for TIFF, IFF, BIFF, NFF, OFF, FITS, etc.\\n\\nYou almost certainly don\\'t need these.  Read the above item 7 on free\\nimage manipulation software.  Get one or more of these packages and\\nlook through them.  Chances are excellent that the image converter you\\nwere going to write is already there.  But if you still want one of the\\nformat documents, many such files are available by anonymous ftp from\\nzamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub/graphics.formats.\\n\\nThese files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct.\\nThis archive includes pixel formats, and two- and three-dimensional object\\nformats.  The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment, as Mark\\nHall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it.\\n\\nA second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained\\nby Quincey Koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu).  The latest version exists at\\nftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.formats/graphics.formats.  Apparently,\\nneither of these is complete, you might want to check both.\\n\\nFITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System. It\\'s a file format most\\noften used in astronomy.  Despite the name, it can contain not only images\\nbut other things as well.  There is a regular monthly FITS basics and\\ninformation posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more.\\n\\n\\n\\n9) Converting between vector formats.\\n\\nA lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript, or MacDraw\\nto CGM, or whatever.  It is important to understand that this is a very\\ndifferent problem from the image format conversions in item 7.  Converting\\none image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once you\\nget past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objects\\nare the same for all image formats.  This is not so for vector formats.\\nThe basic objects -- circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filled\\nround-cornered rectangles, etc. -- vary from one format to another.\\nExcept in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do\\na one-to-one conversion between vector formats.\\n\\nThere is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu.  The\\ncontributor states that it runs on Unix, MS-Windows, and possibly the Mac.\\nA better, more specific blurb would be most welcome.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation,\\nrendering an image from one format using the primitives from another.\\nAs far as I know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such\\nconverters, but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been\\nposted to comp.sources.misc.  Check the index on your nearest archive\\nsite.\\n\\nA related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format\\nto a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format, or HPGL to\\nX11 bitmap.  For example, some of the commercial PostScript clones for\\nPC\\'s allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.  Also,\\nthe PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun\\'s X11/NeWs can\\nbe used to render to a file if you\\'re clever.  But in general, the\\nanswer is no.  However, if someone were to put together a vector to\\nvector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would be\\ntrivial.\\n\\nGNU ghostscript (from the FSF - current version 2.5.2) includes\\ndrivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as\\na PostScript to ppm  or a PostScript to GIF filter.  (It implements\\nessentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScript\\nand level 2).\\n\\n\\n10) How to get Pixar films.\\n\\nThe various John Lasseter / Pixar computer animated shorts are available\\non video tape.  You can order them from Direct Cinema Limited:\\n\\n    Film                           Individual Price      Institutional Price\\n    Luxo, Jr.\\t\\t\\t\\t$14.95\\t\\t\\t$50.00\\n    Red\\'s Dream\\t\\t\\t\\t$19.95\\t\\t\\t$75.00\\n    Tin Toy\\t\\t\\t\\t$24.95\\t\\t\\t$75.00\\n    Knickknack\\t\\t\\t\\t$24.95\\t\\t\\t$75.00\\n    Luxo, Jr./Red\\'s Dream/Tin Toy\\t$39.95\\t\\t\\t$100.00\\n\\nAll tapes are on 1/2\" VHS NTSC.

For institutional orders, add $5 S&H\\nfor the first tape, $3 for each additional tape.  Foreign shipping, add\\n$3/tape or shirt.  Call 800-525-0000 (213-396-4774 international,\\n213-396-3233 FAX) to charge to your credit card.  Call first to verify\\nprices and availability.  Or, just write to:\\n\\n    Direct Cinema Limited\\n    1749 14th Street\\n    Santa Monica, CA 90404-4342\\n\\nAllan Braunsdorf has this to say:\\n\\nAt SIGGRAPH they were selling a tape with all four shorts\\nfor $25.  That was a sale price.  You can get it for slightly\\nmore than that normally.  ($35 maybe.)  I believe it\\'s\\navailable from RenderMan Retail (at Pixar\\'s address).\\n\\n    Pixar\\n    1001 West Cutting Blvd.\\n    Richmond, CA. 94804\\n    (510) 236-4000 \\n    (510) 236-0388 (FAX)\\n\\nYou can obtain a video directly from Pixar which contains \"Luxo, Jr.\", \"Red\\'s\\nDream\", \"Tin Toy\" and \"Knicknack\" for $25.00, plus $2.50 for shipping. They\\nwill take your order over the phone or via FAX with a major credit card. I \\nordered mine just last week and received it several days later. Don\\'t expect \\nto be able to rent a copy from your local video store. According to the license\\nagreement printed on the back cover of the case, it cannot be rented.\\n\\n\\n11) How do I draw a circle as a Bezier (or B-spline) curve?\\n\\nThe short answer is, \"You can\\'t.\"  Unless you use a rational spline you\\ncan only approximate a circle.  The approximation may look acceptable,\\nbut it is sensitive to scale.  Magnify the scale and the error of\\napproximation magnifies.  Deviations from circularity that were not\\nvisible in the small can become glaring in the large.  If you want to\\ndo the job right, consult the article:\\n\\n  \"A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles\"\\n  by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller\\n  in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, volume 9, number 9,\\n  September, 1989, pages 48-56.\\n\\nFor rough, non-rational approximations, consult the book:\\n\\n  Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture\\n  by I. D. Faux and M. J. Pratt,\\n  Ellis Horwood Publishers, Halsted Press, John Wiley 1980.\\n\\nFor the best known non-rational approximations, consult the article:\\n\\n  \"Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves\"\\n  by Tor Dokken, Morten Daehlen, Tom Lyche, and Knut Morken\\n  in Computer Aided Geometric Design, volume 7, numbers 1-4 (combined),\\n  June, 1990, pages 33-41 [Elsevier Science Publishers (North-Holland)]\\n\\n\\n12) How to order standards documents.\\n\\nThe American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards, and also\\nISO (international) standards.  Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900,\\nmailing address is 1430 Broadway, NY NY 10018.  It helps if you have the\\ncomplete name and number.\\n\\nSome useful numbers to know:\\n\\nCGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is ISO 8632-4 (1987).  GKS (Graphical\\nKernel System) is ANSI X3.124-1985.  PHIGS (Programmer\\'s Hierarchical\\nInteractive Graphics System) is ANSI X3.144-1988.  IGES is ASME/ANSI\\nY14.26M-1987.  Language bindings are often separate but related numbers;\\nfor example, the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3.124.1-1985.\\n\\nStandards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicit\\ncomments from the graphical public (this includes you!).  ANSI can let\\nyou know where to order them; most are available from Global Engineering\\nat 1-800-854-7179.\\n\\n\\n13) How to FTP by email.\\n\\nThere are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups\\nand make them available via an email query system.  You send a message\\nto an automated server saying something like \"send comp.sources.unix/fbm\",\\nand a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.\\n\\nIn addition, there is at least one FTP-by-mail server.  Send mail to\\nftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying \"help\" and it will tell you how to use\\nit.  Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse.\\n\\n\\n14) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.\\n\\nConsider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to\\ninfinity.  If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way,\\nthe point is within the polygon.  If the ray crosses an even number of\\nedges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interior\\nhole formed from intersecting polygon edges.  This idea is known in\\nthe trade as the Jordan curve theorem; see Eric Haines\\' article in\\nGlassner\\'s ray tracing book (above) for more information, including\\ntreatment of special cases.\\n\\nAnother method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all\\nthe vertices on the polygon.  If the sum is 2 pi, the point is inside,\\nif the sum is 0 the point is outside.  However, this method is about an\\norder of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the\\ntrigonometric functions is usually quite costly.\\n\\nCode for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found in\\nthe Ray Tracing News, Vol. 5, No. 3, available from princeton.edu:\\npub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z.\\n\\n\\n15) How to tessellate a sphere.\\n\\nOne simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles.  The\\nbase of the recursion is an octahedron, and then each level divides\\neach triangle into four smaller ones.  Jon Leech <leech@cs.unc.edu>\\nhas posted a nice routine called sphere.c that generates the coordinates.\\nIt\\'s available for FTP on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu.\\n\\n16) Specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination.\\n\\nRick Speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography:\\n\\nHighlights of this edition-\\n\\n    i) more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through\\n       November \\'91;\\n    ii) papers from all Siggraph, Graphics Interface, Eurographics, CG\\n        International and Ausgraph proceedings through December, \\'91;\\n    iii) all citations keyworded for easy lookup;\\n    iv) cross-indices by keyword and author;\\n    v)  glossary of the 119 keywords used.\\n\\nThe bib is in the form of a PostScript file.

It is portable and usable upon\\na wide variety of platforms.  It is quite limited in some ways (yes, the\\nkeeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all), and in fact, I don\\'t like\\nit much.  However, it looks to me like the most-Frequently Asked Question\\nwhich was not previously covered in this list.  The following is a list\\nof newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about GIF.\\n\\nSubject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - General info\\nSubject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - OS specific info\\nNewsgroups: alt.binaries.pictures.d,alt.binaries.pictures.misc,\\n\\talt.binaries.pictures.utilities,alt.binaries.pictures.fractals,\\n\\talt.binaries.pictures.fine-art.d,news.answers\\n\\nAvailable in the indicated USENET newsgroup(s), or via anonymous ftp from\\npit-manager.mit.edu in the files:\\n\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2\\n\\nAlso available from mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu by sending a mail\\nmessage containing any or all of:\\n\\nsend usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1\\nsend usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2\\n\\nSend a message containing \"help\" to get general information about the\\nmail server.\\n\\nAlso, you could check out the resources described in sections 7, 8, and\\n20 above for more information.\\n\\n\\n22) What is morphing?\\n\\nWarping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new\\nlocation. Morphing is blending from one image or object to another one.\\nValerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and\\nmorphing. This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au\\nin the directory pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph. There are three files:\\n\\n        morph_intro.ps.Z     (PostScript version, many pictures - 1.5M)\\n        morph_intro.txt.Z    (text version)\\n        m_responses.Z        (Responses to morphing questions)\\n\\nThe files are compressed, so you must use binary transfer and\\nuncompress them afterwards.\\n\\n\\n23) How to ray-trace height fields\\n\\nHeight fields are a special case in ray-tracing.  They have a number of uses,\\nsuch as terrain rendering, and some optimization is possible.  Thus, they\\nget their own FAQ section.  Note that further references can no doubt be\\nlocated via the ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above.\\n\\nThe following paper seems to be the definitive reference:\\n\\nF.

I hope\\nno one here believes that our conservative contributors hold this\\nview.  However there is a basic difference in approach over what we\\nexpect to get out of the Bible.  The conservative approach expects to\\nfind specific behavioral rules.  Generally the posters advocating this\\napproach talk about the relevant passages from Paul\\'s letter as God\\'s\\nLaw.  The liberal approach expects to find general principles, but it\\nregards specific behavioral rules subject to change depending upon the\\nculture and other things.  It\\'s easy to see why a liberal would regard\\nthe conservative approach as legalism.  It\\'s hard to know quite what\\nother term to use.  The issue in this case is not inerrancy, because\\nno one is saying that Paul made a factual error.  Rather, the question\\nis whether his statements are to be taken as Law.  Calling the\\npositive answer legalism seems obvious enough terminology.  I haven\\'t\\nseen any good alternative.\\n\\n--clh]\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

What I am trying to say,\\nin my clumsy way, is that while I buy your theory as far as it relates\\nto theism making predictions (prayer, your \\'Rapture\\' example), I don\\'t\\nbuy your use of Occam\\'s razor in all cases where A=0.\\n\\nIn my example, one couldn\\'t dismiss\\n[benefactor] or [bug] on the grounds of simplicity - one of these is necessary\\nto explain the dosh.  I brought up the \\'one-by-one dismissal\\' process to\\nshow that it would be wrong to do so.  From what you\\'re saying in this\\npost, it seems you agree, and we\\'re talking at cross-purposes.\\n\\n#(3) is still in contradiction to (1).\\n#\\n#Some sums may help. With B = benefactor, b = bug, d = dosh arrives in account:\\n#\\n#  (1) implies  P(B+b | d) = 1\\n#\\n#Assuming that P(Bb | d) = 0, so it\\'s either the benefactor *or* a bug\\n#which is responsible if the bucks arrive, but not both, then\\n#\\n#   P(B+b | d)   =   P(B | d) + P(b | d)\\n#\\n#so\\n#\\n#   P(B | d) + P(b | d)  =  1\\n#\\n#but (3) implies that\\n#\\n#   P(B | d)  =  0  and  P(b | d)  =  0.\\n\\nNo, this isn\\'t what I meant.  P(B | d) = 0.5 and P(b | d) = 0.5, with\\nnecessarily no new observation (we\\'ve already seen the dosh) to change\\nthose estimates.  I was trying to say (again, in my clumsy way) that\\nit would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probability to either of these.  And that\\'s\\nprecisely what use of the Razor does in the case of gods - gods are\\none class of hypothesis (there are many others) belonging to a set of\\nhypotheses _one_of_which_ is necessary to explain something which otherwise \\nwould _not_ be satisfactorily explained.  It can be thrown out or\\nretained on grounds of non-rational preference, not of science or statistics.   \\nAlternatively, one could chuck out or retain the lot, on the grounds\\nthat the answer can\\'t be known, or that the notional probability estimates\\nare effectively useless, being equal (agnosticism/weak atheism).\\n\\n#> As they do when the set M is filled by \"the universe is caused by x\",\\n#> where x is gods, pink unicorns, nothing, etc.  - and no observation\\n#> tends to one conclusion over the other.\\n#\\n#Exactly the point I was making, I think. So we don\\'t \"throw out\" any of\\n#these, contrary to your assertion above that we do.\\n\\nSome people do, Simon, and they think they are doing excellent science.\\nMy sole point was that they aren\\'t.\\n\\n#>> Only observations which directly contradict the hypothesis H[i] (i.e. x\\n#>> where P(x | H[i]) = 0) can cause P(H[i]) to go to zero after a finite\\n#>> number of observations. Only in this case do we get to throw any of the\\n#>> hypotheses out.\\n#\\n#> Exactly my point, though I may have been unclear.\\n#\\n#You said the diametric opposite, which I guess is the source of my confusion.\\n\\nI was merely trying to illustrate the incorrectness of doing so.\\n\\n#> What I\\'m trying to say is that while you are correct to say that absence of\\n#> evidence can sometimes be evidence of absence, this does not hold true for\\n#> all, or perhaps any, versions of theism - and it isn\\'t true that those for\\n#> which it does not hold can be discarded using the razor.\\n#\\n#On the contrary, those for which it does not hold are *exactly* those which\\n#can be discarded using the Razor. See my post on the other branch of this\\n#thread.\\n\\nThen you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of.  If\\nthe razor holds for gods, then it holds for all like hypotheses.  Which\\nmeans that you\\'re assigning P(x | H[i]) =0 for all i, though we\\'ve already\\nestablished that it\\'s not correct to do so when SUM(P(x|H[i]))=1 over\\nall i.\\n\\n#> Simply put, anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or\\n#> non-existence of gods, whether inductive or no, is at best mistaken, and\\n#> at worst barking mad.\\n#\\n#Luckily I make no such claim, and have specifically said as much on numerous\\n#occasions. You wouldn\\'t be constructing a strawman here, would you Frank?\\n#Although that doesn\\'t, of course, rule out my being barking mad in any case\\n#(I could be barking mad in my spare time, with apologies to Cleese et al).\\n#\\n#But I think you miss the point once again. When I say that something is\\n#\"evidence against\" an hypothesis, that doesn\\'t imply that observation of\\n#the said something necessarily *falsifies* the hypothesis, reducing the\\n#estimate of P(H | data) to zero. If it *reduces* this quantity, it\\'s still\\n#evidence against H.\\n\\nNo, I got that.  I\\'m talking about the case when A=0.  You\\'re clearly\\ncorrect when A!=0.   And I\\'m not constructing a strawman (though it\\'s\\ncertainly possible that I\\'ve misunderstood what you\\'re saying).  However,\\nby any standards, a system that says when A=0, gods are highly unlikely,\\nand when A!=0 gods can be dismissed using the Razor, is a system purporting\\nto be an inductive proof that gods either don\\'t exist, or are unnecessary\\nto explain any or all phenomena.  In my experience, systems such as this\\n(including those which purport to prove that gods exist) always contain\\na fallacy upon close examination.

He was\\n    married to a most virtuous young woman and they lived happily  in\\n    a  humble  home which was in the midst of a large, beautiful val-\\n    ley. After living many, happy years together, Jacob\\'s wife\\tdied,\\n    leaving  him alone with only one friend...his daughter Mary. Even\\n    as a child Mary was uncommonly pretty; but as she grew in  years,\\n    her piety, her innocence, her modesty and her unfeigned kindne ss\\n    towards all she came in contact with, gave to her beauty  a  rare\\n    and  peculiar  charm. Her face was lighted up with a look of such\\n    indescribable goodness, that  it  seemed  almost  as  though  one\\n    looked upon an angel.\\n\\n    Mary\\'s greatest delight was the beautiful garden and her  favour-\\n    ite  flowers  were the violet, the lily and the rose. Jacob loved\\n    to point to them as emblems of the virtues most becoming  to  her\\n    gender.  When\\tshe  once, early in March brought the first violet to\\n    him and joyfully called upon him to admire it, he said:\\n\\n    Let the modest violet, my dear Mary, be to you an image of humil-\\n    ity  and  of the benevolence that does good in secret. It clothes\\n    itself in the tender colours of modesty; it prefers to  bloom  in\\n    retired  grots; it fills the air with its fragrance while remain-\\n    ing hidden beneath the leaves.  May you also, my  dear  Mary,  be\\n    like  the  retiring violet, avoiding vain display, not seeking to\\n    attract the public\\teye,  but  preferring  ever  to  do  good  in\\n    quietude and peace.\\n\\n    One morning when the roses and lilies were in full bloom and  the\\n    garden appeared in its richest array, Jacob said to his daughter,\\n    as he pointed out a beautiful lily,  which\\twas  beaming  in  the\\n    morning sun:\\n\\n    Let the lily my dear child, be to you the emblem\\n     of purity. Look how beautiful, how pure and fair it is! The whi-\\n    test  linen is as nothing compared with the purity of its petals:\\n    they are like the snow. Happy the maiden whose heart is  as  pure\\n    and as free from stain. But the purest of all colours is also the\\n    hardest\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   -5-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    to preserve pure. Easily is the petal of the lily  soiled;\\ttouch\\n    it\\tbut carelessly or roughly and a stain is left behind.  In the\\n    same way, a word or a thought may stain the purity of  innocence!\\n    Then pointing to a rose he said:\\n\\n     Let the rose my dear Mary, be to you an emblem of modesty.  More\\n    beautiful  than the colour of the rose is the blush that rises to\\n    the cheek of a modest girl. It is a sign that she is  still  pure\\n    of\\theart  and  innocent in thought. Happy is the maiden whom the\\n    suggestion of a thought that is indelicate, will cause to  blush,\\n    as\\tshe  is thus put on her guard against the approach of danger.\\n    The cheeks which readily blush will remain for a long  time  with\\n    their  roseate  hue, while those which fail to blush at the least\\n    indelicacy of thought will soon  become  pale  and\\twan,  and  go\\n    before their time to the grave.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    Among the many fruit trees that adorned the garden there was  one\\n    that  was  prized above all the others. It was an apple tree, not\\n    much larger than a rose bush, and stood by itself in  the  middle\\n    of\\tthe garden. Mary\\'s father had planted it the day that she was\\n    born and every year it bore a number of beautiful apples. Once it\\n    blossomed  earlier\\tthan  usual  and with unusual luxuriance. The\\n    tree was one mass of blossom. Mary was so delighted with it  that\\n    she went every morning as soon as she was dressed to look at\\n     it. Once, when it was in full bloom, she called  to  her  father\\n    and said:\\n\\n    Look father, how beautiful! Was there ever such a lovely mingling\\n    of\\tred  and  white?  The whole tree looks like one huge bunch of\\n    flowers!\\n\\n    The next morning she hastened into the garden to feast  her  eyes\\n    once  more\\tupon the tree. But what was her grief to see that the\\n    frost had nipped it and destroyed all its flowers. They were  all\\n    become  brown  and\\tyellow\\tand  when  the\\tsun came forth in its\\n    strength they withered and fell to the ground. Mary  wept  bitter\\n    tears at the sight. Then said the father:\\n\\n    Thus, does sinful pleasure destroy the  bloom  of  youth.  Oh  my\\n    child,  never  cease to remember how dreadful it is to be seduced\\n    from the path of right! Behold in the example of the  apple  tree\\n    an\\timage of what would happen if you were to wander from the way\\n    - if the hopes your conduct  hitherto  has\\traised\\tin  my\\theart\\n    should  vanish,  not  merely for a day or year, but for life. Ah,\\n    then how much more bitter would be the tears which I  would  shed\\n    over your lapse from virtue than those which now course down your\\n    cheeks! Life would have no joys for me: with tears in my eyes  I\\n    should\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   -6-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    go down sorrowfully to my grave.\\n\\n    As he spoke, the tears stood in his eyes; Mary was deeply  moved,\\n    and  the words he uttered made so profound an impression upon her\\n    mind that she never forgot them.\\n\\n    Under the eyes of a father so  loving  and\\twise,  and  amid  the\\n    flowers  of  her  garden, Mary grew daily in stature and intelli-\\n    gence - blooming as a rose, pure as a  lily  and  retiring\\tas  a\\n    violet, and as full of promise as a tree laden with blossom.\\n\\n    Happy was the old man at all times to behold how plenteously  the\\n    fruits  of\\this  garden  rewarded his diligent toil; but with how\\n    much more happiness and content did he mark the  gracious  effect\\n    produced  upon  the heart and mind of his beloved daughter by his\\n    pious teaching and example.\\n\\n    Jacob plucked several roses and lilies, tied them together\\tin  a\\n    bunch and gave them to Mary with the words:\\n\\n    The lily and the rose, sister flowers as they are, belong the one\\n    to\\tthe  other;  both incomparable in their beauty, they are ren-\\n    dered still more lovely by being together. In  the\\tsame  way  my\\n    dear  child  are innocence and modesty twin sisters of virtue and\\n    cannot be separated\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    The greatest and most powerful guardian of purity is the  thought\\n    of the presence of God\\n\\n-- \\nInternet: simon@giaeb.cc.monash.edu.au  \\nViva Cristo Rey !!

I suggest\\nthat the weakness is your reference material.  Get \"An Introduction to Ray\\nTracing\" by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing\\nalgorithm.  You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam.\\n\\n    On to the question.  The simple answer is that you just keep adding up\\nall the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  For\\nexample, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding up\\nand clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower\\nbound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that\\'s another issue =^).  So, you\\nget some illumination equation like this:\\n\\n        I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent\\n\\n    The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light\\nintensity, as is the light due to transparency.  Now, a slightly less\\nhand-waving illumination equation is this:\\n\\n        I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt\\n\\n    That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by the\\nmaterial constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt.  So the maximum you can get from\\ntransparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for a\\npurple-colored glass object.\\n\\n    Hopefully this answers your question.

Hate begets more hate, never love.\\n\\n       If you are questioning whether or not \"hating sin\" is consistent with\\n   Christianity; I ask you to consider the following Scripture:\\n\\n       Romans 12:9 \"Let Love be without hypocrisy.  Hate what is evil, cling\\n                    to what is good.\"\\n\\n       What is it that Paul, through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit is\\n   calling us to hate?  Would God call us to do something that would\\n   eventually lead to hating our fellow man; especially when he commands us to\\n   do the opposite, to love your fellow man?\\n\\n   >Consider some sin. Now lets apply our \"hate the sin...\" philosophy and see\\n   >what happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the\\n   >stronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so\\n   >strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to\\n   >hate the sinner.\\n\\n       That has not been my experience.  I\\'ve not found myself hating anybody\\n   as a result of hating the sin that may be in their life.  As a sinner\\n   myself, I find myself having more compassion for the person.  Jesus too,\\n   since the Bible teaches that he was tempted in every way that we are, is\\n   able to have compassion on us when we our tempted and fall.  Jesus is our\\n   very example of HOW to hate the sin but love the sinner.  In the account of\\n   the woman caught in adultery (John 8), Jesus had compassion on the woman;\\n   BUT he also called her to leave her life of sin.  This is what it means to\\n   love sinners but hate their sin; it means loving them unconditionally,\\n   while at the same time calling them to leave their sin.\\n\\n   >In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things\\n   >which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even believe\\n   >what they are doing is a sin).\\n\\n       The blame for this can not always be laid at the feet of the\\n   Christian.  I have seen and been guilty of taking offense by someone merely\\n   pointing out my sin and calling me to repent of it.  It was not unloving\\n   for the Christian to call me out of sin; in fact, I believe it was the most\\n   loving thing that that person could have done.  He loved me enough to want\\n   to spare me the consequence of remaining in my sin.\\n\\n   >After enough of this, the sinner begins to hate us (they certainly don\\'t\\n   >love us for our constant criticism of their behavior). Hate builds up and\\n   >drives people away from God...this certainly cannot be a good way to build\\n   >love.\\n\\n       Again, I don\\'t think that you can lay the blame for this at the feet of\\n   the Christian.  If we have loved them as Jesus loved sinners (exemplified\\n   in John 8) and the sinner hates us for it, then we have done the best we\\n   can.  We will have extended to them the most perfect expression of love and\\n   they will have rejected it.\\n\\n       Now it we hate the sin but forget to love the sinner, then indeed, we\\n   will, ourselves, be in sin.\\n\\n   >In the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our\\n   >neighbors. He doesn\\'t say anything about hate.\\n\\n       I would like to encourage you to do a word study on HATE in the New\\n   Testament.  I really think that you will be surprised.\\n\\n   >In fact, if anything, he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves.\\n\\n       Criticism is very different from calling a sinner to repent.\\n\\n   Hope this helps,\\n   In Christ,\\n   Tony Balsamo\\n--\\n\\n            +--------------------------------------------------+\\n            |   Name: Antonio L.

Fordham von Reyn et al. of the \\nDartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.  The researchers contacted \\n2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performed \\ninvasive  procedures between January 1, 1978 and June 30, 1992.  The  \\northopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positive \\nfor HIV.  A total of 1,174 former patients  underwent HIV testing, \\nrepresenting 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeon \\nperformed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  Patients were \\ntested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  All \\npatients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent  \\nassay.  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery.  \\nThe examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detect \\ncases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients.  The estimated cost of \\nthe initial patient  notification and testing was $158,000, with the single \\nmost  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  This accounted  for 37 \\npercent of the total expense.  The patient notification  and testing were \\nconducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon who \\nwas an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study.  \\nNotifying patients of the  infected surgeon\\'s HIV-status is both disruptive \\nand expensive  and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \\\\ \\n       =================================================================     \\n\"Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of  an HIV-\\nInfected Surgeon\" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 38\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n269,  No. 14, P. 1795  (Smith Rogers, Audrey et al.) \\n\\n     The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will be \\nquantified only by gathering data from multiple,  methodologically similar \\ninvestigations, writes Audrey Smith  Rogers et al. of the Johns Hopkins \\nUniversity School of Medicine  in Baltimore, Md.  The researchers identified a \\ntotal of 1,131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical  \\nprocedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive  surgeon was \\nlisted as the operating surgeon.  The AIDS case  registries were reviewed for \\nall patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates were \\nobtained.  Among  the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413 \\nhad  test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. No \\nstudy patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newly \\ndetected, HIV-positive patient was determined to have  been most probably \\ninfected in 1985 during a transfusion.  There  was no HIV transmission in 369 \\nperson-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that HIV transmission to \\npatients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours \\nof surgical  exposure.  The researchers determined there is no evidence to  \\nsuggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-control \\nguidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose to \\nbe tested, and of those whose  results were revealed, only one person was \\nfound to be infected  with HIV.  The study patient\\'s infection was probably \\nthe result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  As a result,  \\nthere is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the  HIV-positive \\nsurgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers  conclude. \\n      ==================================================================\\n                                April 20, 1993 \\n      ==================================================================\\n \"Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data\" New York Times (04/20/93), P. C10  \\n(Kolata, Gina) \\n\\n     A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a  highly \\nunusual move, to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs are \\nundergoing early clinical testing.  Dr. Edward  Scolnick, president of the \\nMerck Research Laboratory in Rahway,  N.J., arranged the collaboration.  He \\nsaid that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as it \\nhad  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effective \\nin fighting HIV than any drug used alone.  The  researchers are hopeful that \\nHIV, when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation at \\ndifferent sites for  resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all the \\nmutations at the same time.  Therefore, several drugs taken together or one \\nafter the other could halt the spread of HIV.  Currently, the  drug companies \\ndo not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  The new \\nagreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety data \\non new AIDS drugs.  \"An  agreement like this will greatly facilitate \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 39\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\ncompanies\\' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a \\nmuch more  efficient way,\" said Scolnick.  He also said that the  \\ncollaboration would not violate antitrust laws.  In creating the  agreement, \\nMerck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy  groups, including ACT-UP.  \\nDr. Daniel Hoth, director of the  division on AIDS at the National Institute \\nof Allergy and  Infectious Disease said, \"We\\'re delighted to see the  \\npharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing the \\ninformation flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds for \\nAIDS.\"  Related Stories: Wall Street Journal (04/20) P.

However, a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should \\nnot be used early in the course of disease.  While the CD4 counts of the 877 \\npeople given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receiving \\nonly placebo, the first three  years of follow-up have shown that the \\nproportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to \\ndeath were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  The  \\nconclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIV-infected \\nindividuals, and that CD4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for the \\nprogression to AIDS in infected people.   But nothing is implied by the study \\nof the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have already \\nappeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the  \\nevidence now available.  It is much more alarming that the CD4  count has \\nproven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV \\ninfection.  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from the \\nbeginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress of \\ndisease.  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itself \\nprovide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, concludes  \\nMaddox. \\n      ================================================================== \\n\"Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From  HIV-1-Infected \\nWomen\" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 914   (Van de Perre, Philippe \\net al.) \\n\\n     A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of  the IgM \\ntype in the mother\\'s body fluids could be valuable to  prevent transmission of \\nHIV-1 from mother to child, write  Philippe Van de Perre et al. of the \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 40\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nNational AIDS Control Program in Kigali, Rwanda.  The researchers hypothesized \\nthat  transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the  \\npresence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective  substances in \\nbreastmilk, or both factors.  A total of 215  HIV-1-infected women were \\nenrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6 \\nmonths, and 18 months post partum.  HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM were \\nassayed by  western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with  \\nprotein G.  In the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers  sought viral \\ngenome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets of \\nprimers (gag, pol, and env).  At 15  days, 6 months, and 18 months post \\npartum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97 \\npercent of breastmilk  samples; IgA in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent; \\nand IgM  in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent.  In children who  survived \\nlonger than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack of \\npersistence of IgM and IgA in their  mothers\\' milk.  The presence of HIV-1-\\ninfected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive of \\nHIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis.  \\nThe  combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM \\nresponse was the strongest predictor of infection.  IgM and  IgA anti-HIV-1 in \\nbreastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV, the researchers \\nconclude. \\n      ==================================================================    \\n                                April 21, 1993 \\n      ==================================================================    \\n\"Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture\" Journal of Commerce \\n(04/21/93), P. 7A \\n\\n     A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies  announced \\nTuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDS \\nresearch to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight HIV \\ninfection and AIDS.

(As an aside, it\\'s\\ninteresting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up,\\nsome books (defaming certain ethnic and religious groups) continued\\nto be banned here. It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these\\n\\ngroups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of \\nhate towards these groups. For Muslims this kind of double standard \\nwas annoying.)\\n\\nRushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at\\n\"organized\"\\nIslam, and he did so with admirable verbal skill. The only kind of Islam\\nwhich Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a \"secular\" Islam - an Islam\\nseparated from it\\'s Qur\\'an, it\\'s Prophet, God, its legislation, and most\\nimportantly from any intrusion into any political arena. Fine - Rushdie\\nmade\\nhis views known - the Muslim\\'s made their anger at his book known. The\\nscale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions - it was, by this\\ntime,\\nalready a political situation - affecting governments as well as\\nindividuals.\\nThe situation was a serious one, with far-reaching political implications.\\nAt the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie, throwing fuel on the fire -\\nengaged\\nin a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution.\\n\\nNow you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as\\n\\nthis has no responsibility, has no reason to exercise restraint of any\\nkind, has no\\nobligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till\\nmatters calm down. Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in \"boldly\"\\ndefying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary\\nwork, no matter what insult they find within it. Perhaps you see him as\\na kind of secular \"heroic Knight\",mounted on the his media steed,\\n doing battle with the \"dragon\" of Islamic \"fundamentalism\".\\n\\nWell Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who \\ngrew up in a Muslim atmosphere, knew well what Muslim\\'s hold dear, \\nwho wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions\\nto slander, insult, and attack Islam and its most notable personalities -\\nwho, when\\nfaced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis, continued with\\nhis mischief in the world stage of the media - who, even after people were\\ninjured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation,\\ncontinued his mischief, instead of having the good sense to desist.\\nKhomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale, mischief\\nmaking that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged. The deaths\\nof Muslims around the world and Rushdie\\'s continued media mischief\\neven after this, was the triggering factor that seemed to\\ndecide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief. The person at the\\ncentre of all these events was Rushdie - he was the source of the\\ncontinuing mischief - all media support, government support was\\njust that - support. The source was Rushdie (and his publishers, who\\nwere nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy\\nto see Rushdie constantly in the media). The Islamic rulings that\\ndeal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief\\nmaking, was applied to Rushdie.\\n\\n>You\\'re attempts at justification are not doing the\\n> image of Islam any good.\\n\\nI have made no attempts at justification, only at explanation. \"Image\" is\\nthe chief concern of Muslim \\'apologists\\' for Islam and for Rushdie.\\nIf Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub-culture\\nwithin a larger secular culture, such that the secular principles and laws\\nhad precedence over the laws of Islam - then I have no doubt that Islam\\nwould then be thought to have a good \"image\" (Principally because it would\\nby and large reflect the secular image). A \"good image\" usually means \" be\\nmore\\nlike me\".\\n\\nYour attempts at TOTALLY exonerating Rushdie reflect exactly the attitude\\nthat\\nresulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis.\\n\\n>  In Iran, the situation was monitored for many\\n> >months - when Rushdie kept adding fuel to the flames through the free\\n> >worldwide voice that the media gave him, the situation was monitored\\n> >more seriously.

There are four slightly different FAX formats --\\nagain, any one of them would have been adequate.

And the LZW method compresses\\nbytes rather than pixels.\\n\\nBut the absolute worst thing about TIFF is that any vendor can register\\nproprietary TIFF codes and formats without even publicly documenting them.\\nThis means that there is NO WAY to write a TIFF reader that can reliably\\nread all incoming TIFF files.

            "'From: aaronc@athena.mit.edu (Aaron Bryce Cardenas)\\nSubject: Baptism requires Faith\\nOrganization: Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\nLines: 144\\n\\nIt troubles me that there have been so many posts recently trying to support\\nthe doctrine of Original Sin.  This is primarily a Catholic doctrine, with no\\nother purpose than to defend the idea of infant baptism.  Even among, its\\nsupporters, however, people will stop short of saying that unbaptised infants\\nwill go to hell.\\n\\nIt\\'s very easy for just about anyone to come up with a partial list of\\nscripture to support any sort of wrong doctrine.  However, if we have the\\nheart to persevere in our beliefs to make sure that they are biblically\\nbased, then we can come to an understanding of the truth.  Let\\'s now take a\\nmore complete look at scripture.\\n\\nColossians 2:11-12 \"In him you were also circumcised, in the putting off of\\nthe sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by Christ, having been\\nburied with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the\\npower of God, who raised him from the dead.\"\\n\\nIn baptism, we are raised to a new life in Christ (Romans 6:4) through a\\npersonal faith in the power of God.  Our parent\\'s faith cannot do this.  Do\\ninfants have faith?  Let\\'s look at what the Bible has to say about it.\\n\\nRomans 10:16-17 \"But not all the Israelites accepted the good news.  For\\nIsaiah says, \\'Lord, who has believed our message?\\'  Consequently, faith\\ncomes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word\\nof Christ.\"\\n\\nSo then we receive God\\'s gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the\\ngospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing God\\'s word preached.  Kids\\nare not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to\\nrespond to God\\'s word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot\\nbe raised in baptism to a new life.\\n\\nEzekiel 18:20 \"The soul who sins will die.  The son will not share the\\nguilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son.  The\\nrighteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him, and the\\nwickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.\"\\n\\nIf you read all of Ezekiel 18, you will see that God doesn\\'t hold us guilty\\nfor anyone else\\'s sins.  So we can have no original guilt from Adam.\\n\\nEzekiel 18:31-32 \"Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted,\\nand get a new heart and a new spirit.  Why will you die, O house of Israel?\\nFor I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord.\\nRepent and live!\"\\n\\nThe way to please God is to repent and get a new heart and spirit.  Kids\\ncannot do this.  Acts 2:38-39 says that when we repent and are baptized, we\\nwill then receive a new spirit, the Holy Spirit.  Then we shall live.\\n\\nNow then that we have a little more background as to why original sin is\\nnot Biblical, let\\'s look at some of the scriptures used to support it.\\n\\nRomans 5:12 \"Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and\\ndeath through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all\\nsinned--\"\\n\\nSin and death entered the world when the first man sinned.  Death came to\\neach man because each man sinned.  Note that it\\'s good to read through all\\nof Romans 5:12-21.  Some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than\\nothers, but if we read them in context we will see that they are all\\nsaying basically the same thing.  Let\\'s look at one such.\\n\\nRomans 5:19 \"For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many\\nwere made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many\\nwill be made righteous.\"\\n\\nThrough the disobedience of each individual, each was made a sinner.  In\\nthe same way, through the obedience of Jesus, each will be made righteous.\\nWe must remember when reading through this passage that death came to each\\nman only because each man sinned, not because of guilt from Adam.\\nOtherwise the Bible would contradict itself.  I encourage you to read\\nthrough this whole passage on your own, looking at it from this point of\\nview to see if it doesn\\'t all fit together.\\n\\nPsalm 51:5 \"Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother\\nconceived me.\"\\n\\nThis whole Psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves\\nbefore God in repentance for sinning.  David himself was a man after God\\'s\\nown heart and wrote the Psalm after committing adultry with Bathsheba and\\nmurdering her husband.  All that David is saying here is that he can\\'t\\nremember a time when he wasn\\'t sinful.  He is humbling himself before God\\nby confessing his sinfulness.  His saying that he was sinful at birth is\\na hyperbole.  The Bible, being inspired by God, isn\\'t limited to a literal\\ninterpetation, but also uses figures of speech as did Jesus (John 16:25).\\nFor another example of hyperbole, see Luke 14:26.\\n\\nNow then, even though people see that baptism requires faith and that\\noriginal sin is not Biblical, they will still argue that infant baptism is\\nnecessary because children sin by being selfish - not sharing toys with\\nother children, by being mean - hitting others and fighting, etc.\\n\\nCertainly we have observed children doing wrong things, but my gut feeling\\nis always that they don\\'t know any better.  Let\\'s look to see if the Bible\\nagrees with my gut feelings.\\n\\nIsaiah 7:14-15 \"Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign:  The\\nvirgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him\\nImmanuel.  He will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the\\nwrong and choose the right.\"\\n\\nNow just about any church leader will tell you that this is a prophecy\\nabout Jesus.  If they don\\'t, then point them to Matthew 1:23 and find a new\\nleader.  Jesus certainly couldn\\'t have had less knowledge than normal human\\nbabies.  Yet this passage says that he had to mature to a certain extent\\nbefore he would know the difference between right and wrong.  We see that\\nhe did grow and become wiser in Luke 2:40 and 2:52.  The implication is\\nthat Jesus did wrong things as a child before he knew to choose right over\\nwrong.  Since we know that Jesus was perfect -- without sin, we have rather\\nconclusive proof that babies cannot sin because they don\\'t know to choose\\nthe right instead of the wrong.\\n\\nJesus himself was baptized, albeit with John\\'s baptism, not as an infant,\\nbut as a thirty-year-old man (Luke 3:21-23) and started his ministry as\\nsoon as he was baptized (Luke 3:23).  Immediately afterwards, he was\\ntempted by the devil (Luke 4:1-13; Matthew 4:1-11; Mark 1:12-13).\\n\\nThank you for your attention.\\n\\nModerator - this should finish up the subject for a while.  Perhaps you\\nwould like to make a FAQ out of this response so that you can repost it\\nfrom time to time when the topic comes up.  Feel free to rearrange the\\ncontents if you would like to, but please send me a copy of the final FAQ.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nAaron Cardenas\\naaronc@athena.mit.edu\\n\\n[I think you\\'re overly optimistic about the authoritative quality of\\nyour response.  First, original sin is not a Catholic-only doctrine.\\nIt was held by Luther and Calvin as well, and is still present in one\\nform or another in the Lutheran and Reformed traditions.  Second,\\nsaying that it has no other purpose than defending infant baptism is\\nan ad hominem argument, which has considerable evidence against it.\\nThe original Baptist theology included original sin, and some Baptists\\nstill hold it.  And there are certainly groups that baptize infants\\nwithout believing in original sin.  Among Protestants, the sacraments\\ntend to be a bit more symbolic than among Catholics.  Protestants who\\nbaptize infants see baptism as a sign of God\\'s acceptance of us,\\nrather than our acceptance of God.  In traditional Protestant\\ntheology, God\\'s grace precedes our response, and is applicable to\\nchildren.  There are a number of passages one can cite to indicate\\nthat God accepts even children.  --clh]\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

Prayers such as:\\n\"Break the arm of the wicked and evil men; call him to account for\\nhis wickedness ...\" Psalm 10:15 did not seem consistent with the\\ngospel of love which I had accepted. Yet Psalm 10:15 was clearly\\nmotivated by love for God (\"The Lord is King for ever and ever;\\nthe nation will perish from His land\" 10:16, and \"Why does the\\nwicked man revile God? 10:13), and by love for the innocent who\\nsuffer (\"You hear, O Lord, the desire of the afflicted; You\\nencourage them, and You listen to their cry, defending the\\nfatherless and oppressed, in order that man, who is of the earth,\\nmay terrify no more.\" 10:17-18)\\n\\nNevertheless, I grew increasingly uncomfortable reading such\\ngraphic prayers for God to judge the wicked as: \"Pour out your\\nwrath on them; let Your fierce anger overtake them\" 64:24; \"O\\nLord, the God avenges, O God who avenges, shine forth. Rise up, O\\nJudge of the earth, pay back to the proud what they deserve.\"\\n95:1-2; \"Break the teeth in their mouths, O God; ...let them\\nvanish like water .. let their arrows be blunted ... The\\nrighteous will be glad when they are avenged, when they bathe\\ntheir feet in the blood of the wicked. Then men will way, \"Surely\\nthe righteous still are rewarded; surely there is a God who\\njudges the earth.\\'\" 58:6-11\\n\\nCertainly I wanted God to be honoured and yes I was deeply\\ndestressed by the prevalence of evil -  but could I actually pray\\nfor God to \"pour out His wrath\" on the wicked?\\n\\nThe scripture make it clear that these prayers are not to be\\nprayed for own selfish motives, nor against our personal enemies.\\nRather they are to be prayed in Christ, for His glory and against\\nHis enemies. The psalmist describes the targets of these\\nimprecation as: those who devise injustice in their heart and\\nwhose hands mete out violence (58:2) those who \"boast of evil\"\\nand \"are a disgrace in the eyes of God. Your tongue plots\\ndestruction, it is like a sharpened razor, and you who practise\\ndeceit. You love evil rather than good, falsehood rather than\\nspeaking the truth.\" 52:1-3; \"They crush your people ... They\\nslay the widow and the alien; they murder the fatherless.\" 94:5-\\n6; \"With cunning they conspire against Your people; they plot\\nagainst those You cherish.\" 83:3; \"You hate all who do wrong. You\\ndestroy those who tell lies; bloodthirsty and deceitful men the\\nLord abhors.\" 5:5-6.\\n\\nTo those unrepentant enemies of God the psalmist declares:\\n\"Surely God will bring you down to everlasting ruin\" 52:5;\\n\"Surely God will crush the heads of His enemies ... of those who\\ngo on in their sins\" 68:21.\\n\\nAnd the purpose of these prayers for justice is declared: \"Then\\nit will be known to the ends of the earth that God rules ...\"\\n59:13; \"to proclaim the powers of God\" 68:34; \"All kings will bow\\ndown to Him and all nations will serve Him \" 72:11; \"Who knows\\nthe power of Your anger? For Your wrath is as great as the fear\\nthat is due You. \" 90:11\\n\\nYet despite the fact that 90 of the 150 Psalms include\\nimprecations (prayers invoking God\\'s righteous judgement upon the\\nwicked) such prayers are rare in the average Western church.\\nHowever, amongst the persecuted churches these prayers are much\\nmore common.\\n\\n\\nPRAYING AGAINST THE PERSECUTORS\\n\\nAmidst the burnt out churches and devastation of Marxist Angola I\\nfound the survivors of communist persecution including the\\ncrippled and maimed, and widows and orphans praying for God to\\nstrike down the wicked and remove the persecutors of the Church.\\nI was shocked - yet it was Biblical (Even the martyrs in heaven\\npray \"How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge\\nthe inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?\" Revelation\\n6:10).\\n\\nThe initiator of the communist persecution in Angola was Agestino\\nNeto. Described as a \"drunken, psychotic, marxist poet\", Neto had\\nbeen installed by Cuban troops as the first dictator of Angola.\\nHe boasted that: \"Within 20 years there won\\'t be a Bible or a\\nchurch left in Angola. I will have eradicated Christianity.\" Yet\\ndespite the vicious wave of church burning and massacres it is\\nnot Christianity that was eradicated in Angola but Agestino Neto.\\nNeto died in mysterious circumstances on an operating table in\\nMoscow.\\n\\nIn Romania I learnt of a series of remarkable incidents recorded\\nof God judging the persecutors of the Church in answer to prayer:\\n  *  A communist official ordered a certain pastor to be\\n     arrested. the next day the official died of a heart attack.\\n  *  Another communist party official ordered that all the Bibles\\n     in his district were to be collected and pulped, to be\\n     turned into toilet paper. This blasphemous project was in\\n     fact carried out. But the next day when the official was\\n     medically examined, he was informed that he had terminal\\n     cancer. He died shortly afterwards.\\n  *  On another occasion, a communist official who had ordered a\\n     Baptist church to be demolished by bulldozers died in a car\\n     crash the very next day.\\n  *  When an order was given to dismantle a place of worship on\\n     the mountainside in a forest, the workmen flatly refused to\\n     carry out the order. At gunpoint a group of conscripted\\n     gypsies also refused to touch the church. In desperation,\\n     the communist police forced prisoners at bayonet-point to\\n     dismantle the structure. Yet the officer in charge pleaded\\n     with the local Christians to pray for him, that God would\\n     not judge him. He emphasised that he had nothing against\\n     Christians and was only obeying strict orders. The building\\n     was in fact reconstructed later, and again used for worship.\\n     \"They were all seized with Sear and the Name of the Lord\\n     Jesus was held in high honour... in this way the Word of the\\n     Lord spread widely and grew in power. \" Acts 19:17,20\\n\\nNicolae Ceaucescu the dictator who ordered much of the\\npersecution in Romania was overthrown by his own army and\\nexecuted on Christmas day, 1989, to joyous shouts of \"the\\nantiChrist is dead\" in the streets. Many testified that this was\\nin answer to the fervent prayers of the long suffering people of\\nRomania.\\n\\nAnother persecutor of the Church who challenged God was Samora\\nMachel, the first dictator of Marxist Mozambique. Samora Machel\\nwas a cannibal who ate human flesh in witchcraft ceremonies in\\nthe 1960\\'s. He pledged his soul to Satan and vowed that he would\\ndestroy the Church and turn Mozambique into the first truly\\nMarxist-Leninist state in Africa. Thousands of churches in\\nMozambique were closed confiscated, \"nationalised\" chained and\\npadlocked, burnt down or boarded up. Missionaries were expelled,\\nsome being imprisoned first. Evangelism was forbidden. Bibles\\nwere ceremonially burnt and tens of thousands of Christians,\\nincluding many pastors and elders, were shipped off to\\nconcentration camps - most were never seen again.\\n\\nA month before his sudden death Samora Machel cursed God publicly\\nand challenged Him to prove His existence by striking him\\n(Machel) dead. On 19 October 1986, while several churches were\\nspecifically praying for God to stop the persecution in\\nMozambique, Machel\\'s Soviet Tupelov aircraft crashed in a violent\\nthunderstorm. The plane crashed 200 metres within South Africa\\'s\\nboundary with Mozambique. Amidst the wreckage the marxist plans\\nfor overthrowing the government of Malawi were discovered and\\npublished. Not only had God judged a blasphemer and a persecutor,\\nbut He had also saved a country from persecution.\\n\\nIn the months leading up to the first multi-party elections in\\nZambia many churches fasted and prayed tor God to remove the 27\\nyear socialist dictatorship of Kenneth Kaunda. This was done on\\n31st October 1991 when Fredrick Chiluba (a man converted to\\nChrist whilst imprisoned for opposing Kaunda) was elected\\npresident of Zambia and covenanted to make Zambia a Christian\\ncountry.\\n\\nIt is recorded in history that the wicked Mary, Queen of Scots,\\ndeclared trembling and in tears: \"I am more afraid of John Knox\\'s\\nprayers than of an army of ten thousand\".\\n\\nOn 3 April 1993 the Secretary General of the South African\\nCommunist Party Chris Hani was shot dead. From the unprecedented\\ninternational wave of condolences and adulation reported one\\ncould be forgiven for assuming that this man was a saint and a\\nmartyr. Certainly it was not the death and resurrection of Christ\\nJesus which dominated the thoughts and headlines of South Africa\\nthis Easter, but the assassination of Chris Hani.\\n\\nThe stunning hypocrisy of the situation is that 20 135 people\\nwere murdered in South Africa in 1992, yet more collective\\nconcern and anguish were reported over the death of the head of\\nthe SA Communist Party than for all the thousands of other\\nvictims. Indeed the SA government, the international community\\nand the mass media have apparently had greater sorrow reported\\nover this one death than for all the 50 000 South Africans\\nmurdered since 2nd February 1990 when the ANC, SACP and PAC were\\nunbanned!\\n\\nYet as a member of the ANC Revolutionary Council since 1973,\\nDeputy Commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) the ANC\\'s \"military\\nwing\" - from 1982, and Chief of Staff of MK from 1987, Chris Hani\\nhad approved and ordered bombings and assassinations of many\\nunarmed civilians. As Jesus warned: \"all who live by the sword\\nwill die by the sword \" Matt 26:52.\\n\\nAfter personally confronting Hani about his terrorist activities\\nat a press conference in Washington DC (where he publicly\\ndeclared his support for Fidel Castro, Col. Gaddafi, Yasser\\nArafat and Saddam Hussein and defended the placing of car bombs\\nand limpet mines in public places during \"the struggle\") I told\\nhim that I was a Christian and, while I didn\\'t hate him, I did\\nhate communism and I was praying for him - that God would either\\nbring him to repentance and salvation in Christ, or that God\\nwould remove him. He responded by swearing and declaring that he\\nwas an atheist.\\n\\nSeveral other people also prayed that God would either bring Hani\\nto repentance or remove him. Similarly several churches in\\nAmerica have begun to pray the imprecatory Psalms against\\nunrepentant abortionists. In one town 8 abortionists were struck\\ndown, with heart attacks, strokes, car accidents and cancer,\\nwithin months of these public prayers for God to stop these\\nkillers of preborn babies.\\n\\nSome praised God for His righteous acts of judgement and quoted:\\n\"When justice is done, it brings joy to the righteous and terror\\nto evildoers \" Proverbs 21:15. Others were shocked that any\\nChristian could express satisfaction at the misfortune of any -\\neven of the blatantly wicked. Yet the Apostles prayed imprecatory\\nprayers (Acts 13:8-12; Galatians 1:8-9; 2 Tim 4:14-15) and so did\\nour Lord (Matt 11:20-24).\\n\\nWhat then should our attitude towards the imprecatory Psalms be?\\nShould we be praying the Psalms? To tackle these thorny issues I\\nwould like to present a short summary of an excellent book, \"War\\nPsalms of the Prince of Peace - Lessons From The Imprecatory\\nPsalms\" by James E Adams, (published by the Presbyterian and\\nReformed Publishing Company):\\n\\nOur Lord Jesus Christ & His apostles used the Psalms constantly\\nin teaching men to know God. The New Testament (NT) quotes the\\nOld Testament (OT) over 283 times. 41% of all OT quotes in the NT\\nare from the Psalms. Christ Himself alluded to the Psalms over 50\\ntimes. The Psalms are the Prayer Book of the Bible.\\n\\n\\n1. Are the imprecatory Psalms the oracles of God?\\n\\nSome Christian commentators & theologians reject these Psalms as\\n\"devilish\", \"diabolical \", \"unsuited to the church\", and \"Not God\\n\\'s pronouncements of His wrath on the wicked; but the prayers of\\na man for vengeance on his enemies, just the opposite of Jesus\\'\\nteaching that we should love our enemies. \"\\n\\nYet 2 Tim 3:16-17 declares:\\n\"All Scripture is God breathed and is useful for teaching,\\nrebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the\\nman of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. \"\\n(see also 2 Peter 3:15-16).\\n\\nThe fact that something in the Word of God is beyond our\\ncomprehension is not grounds to denying or even questioning its\\ninspiration. To make ourselves the judge of what is good or evil\\nis to impudently take the place of God.\\n\\nDo we imagine ourselves to be holier than God? Wrong ideas of God\\nhave led many to become \"evangelic plastic surgeons who have made\\nit their job to \"clean up\" God\\'s Word according to their own\\nideas of what is proper. They have forgotten that it is God alone\\nwho must determine what Christianity is and what is suitable for\\nHis Church. The essence of what many have done is to question the\\nauthority of God\\'s Word (like Eve\\'s original sin of listening to\\nSatan\\'s question \"Yes, hath God said... ?\").\\n\\nThe Psalms are part of God\\'s revelation of Himself and His\\nattributes, and they are reaffirmed by the NT as the\\nauthoritative Word of God. Those imprecatory Psalms which these\\nevangelical plastic surgeons reject as \"unsuited\" and \"unworthy\"\\nfor the Church are the very Psalms Christ used to testify about\\nHimself (eg: Mark 12:36; Matt 22:43-44) and which the Apostles\\nused as authoritative Scripture (eg: Acts 1:16-20; Acts 4:25; Heb\\n4:7). See also: 2 Samuel 23:1-2.\\n\\nCH Spurgeon said concerning the imprecatory Psalms, (especially\\nPs 109):\\n\"Truly this is one of the hard places of Scripture, a passage\\nwhich the soul trembles to read, yet it is not ours to sit in\\njudgement upon it, but to bow our ear to what the Lord would\\nspeak to us therein. \"\\n\\nThe rejection of any part of God\\'s Word is a rejection of the\\ngiver of that Word, God Himself.\\n\\n\\n2. Who is praying these Psalms?\\n\\nChrist quoted the Psalms not merely as prophesy; He actually\\nspoke the Psalms as His own words. The Psalms occupied an\\nenormous place in the life of our Lord. He used it as His prayer\\nbook and song book - from the Synagogue to the festivals and at\\nthe Last Supper.\\n\\nOn the cross Christ quoted from the Psalms - not as some ancient\\nauthority that He adapted for His own use, but as His very own\\nwords - the words of the Lord\\'s Anointed - which as David\\'s Son\\nHe truly was.\\n\"Father, into your hands I commit my Spirit\" Ps 31:5\\n\"My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?\" Ps 22:1\\n\\nIn His ministry Christ foretells what He will say as the Judge on\\nthe day of judgement, and He quotes the Psalms in doing so!\\nMatt 7:23 \"Then I will tell them plainly, \\'I never knew you. Away\\nfrom me, you evildoers\\'. \" Ps 6:8\\n\\nIn Heb 10:5 the apostle attributes Ps 40:6-8 directly to Christ\\nalthough nowhere in the Gospels is Christ recorded as having said\\nthese words. Similarly Hebrews 2 : 12 attributes Ps 22:22\\ndirectly to Christ despite there being no record of His having\\nspoken these words while on earth. Clearly the apostles believed\\nChrist is speaking in the Psalms.\\n\\nChrist came to establish His kingdom and to extend His mercy in\\nall the earth. But let us never forget that Jesus will come again\\nto execute Judgement on the wicked.\\nDavid as the anointed king of the chosen people of God was a\\nprototype of Jesus Christ. Acts 2:30:\\n\"being therefore a prophet, ... he foresaw and spoke of the\\nresurrection of Christ. \"\\nDavid was a witness to Christ in his office, in his lite, and in\\nhis words. The same words which David spoke, the future Messiah\\nspoke through him. The prayers of David were prayed also by\\nChrist. Or better Christ Himself prayed these Psalms through His\\nforerunner David.\\n\\nThe imprecatory Psalms are expressions of the infinite justice of\\nGod, of His indignation against wrong doing, and His compassion\\nfor the wronged.\\n\\n\\n3. But what about the Psalms of repentance?\\n\\nChrist is also the Lamb of God, the substitutionary sacrifice for\\nour sins. Christ in the day of His crucifixion was charged with\\nthe sin of His people. He appropriated to Himself those debts for\\nwhich He had made Himself responsible. Our Lord was the\\nsubstitution for the sinner. He took the sinners place (Isaiah\\n53).\\n\\n\"God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we\\nmight become the righteousness of God. \" 2 Cor 5:21\\n\\nIn history the Psalms, especially the imprecatory Psalms, have\\nbeen understood to have been the prayers of Christ by: St\\nAugustine, Jerome, Ambrose, Tertullian, Luther and many others.\\nAll the Psalms are the voice of Christ. Christ is praying the\\nimprecatory Psalms! All the Psalms are messianic. It is the Lord\\nJesus Christ who is praying these prayers of vengeance. It is\\nonly right for the righteous King of Peace to ask God to destroy\\nHis enemies.\\n\\nThese prayers signal an alarm to all who are still enemies of\\nKing Jesus. His prayers will be answered! God\\'s Word is revealed\\nupon all who oppose Christ. Anyone who rejects God\\'s way of\\nforgiveness in the cross of Christ will bear the dreadful curses\\nof God.\\n\\nHe who prays Psalm 69:23-28 will one day make this prayer a\\nreality when He declares to those on His left:\\n\"Depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared\\nfor the devil and his angels. \" Matt 25:41\\n\\nAll the enemies of the Lord need to hear these Psalms. *God\\'s\\nKingdom is at War.* The powers of evil will tall and God alone\\nwill reign forever!\\n\"With justice He judges and makes war...out of His mouth comes a\\nsharp sword with which to strike down the nations. He will rule\\nthem with an iron sceptre; He treads the winepress of the fury of\\nthe wrath of God Almighty...King of Kings and Lord of Lords. \"\\nRev 19 : 15\\n\\n\\n4. Are Jesus\\' prayers contradictory?\\n\\nWhat about Jesus\\' command to love our enemies and to bless those\\nwho curse us (Matt 5:44)?\\n\\nChrist is of course the loving and merciful Saviour who forgives\\nsin; but He is also the awesome Judge who is coming in Judgement\\non those who disobey His Gospel.\\n\\n\"God is just. He will pay back trouble to those who trouble you\\nand give relief to you who are troubled...This will happen when\\nthe Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with His\\npowerful angels. He will punish those who do not obey the Gospel\\nof our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting\\ndestruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from\\nthe majesty of His power on the day He comes to be glorified in\\nHis holy people and to be marvelled at among au those who have\\nbelieved. \" 2 Thess 1:6-10\\n\\nJesus has power on earth to forgive sins, and He has power on\\nearth to execute judgement upon His enemies. In the Psalms we see\\nboth the vengeance and the love ot God.\\n\\nEven in the N.T. & in the Gospels we see imprecations.\\n\"Woe to you,...hypocrites...blind guides...blind fools...full of\\ngreed and self indulgence...whitewashed tombs...you snakes! You\\nbrood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to Hell ? \"\\nMatt 23\\n\\nIn Matt 26:23-24 Christ quotes from Ps 69 and 109 to refer to His\\nbetrayal by Judas.\\n\\nWe also need to acknowledge that Christ\\'s prayers of blessing are\\nnot for all. In John 17:6-9 it is clear that Christ is only\\npraying to the elect of God - those who have:\\n\"obeyed your Word\"... \"accepted\" God\\'s Word ... and have\\n\"believed \". (see Luke 10:8-16 - Those who reject the\\nmessage of God\\'s kingdom will be judged.)\\n\\n\\n5. May we pray the imprecatory Psalms?\\n\\nMartin Luther pointed out that when one prays: \"Hallowed be Thy\\nName, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done \" then \"he must put all\\nthe opposition to this in one pile and say: \\'Curses, maledictions\\nand disgrace upon every other name and every other kingdom. May\\nthey be ruined and torn apart and may all their schemes and\\nwisdom and plans run aground\\' . \"\\n\\nTo pray tor the extension of God\\'s kingdom is to solicit the\\ndestruction of all other kingdoms, eg: Dan 2:44: \"The God of\\nheaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed ... it\\nwill crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it\\nwill itself endure forever. \"\\n\\n* Advance and victory for the Church means defeat and retreat for\\nthe kingdom of darkness. *\\n\\nThere is a life & death struggle between two kingdoms. The Church\\ncannot exclude hatred tor satan\\'s kingdom from its love for God\\'s\\nkingdom. God\\'s kingdom cannot come without satan\\'s kingdom being\\ndestroyed. God\\'s will cannot be done on earth without the\\ndestruction of evil. The glory of God demands the destruction of\\nevil. Instead of being influenced by a sickly sentimentalism\\nwhich insists upon the assumed, but really non-existent, rights\\nof man - we should focus instead upon the rights of God.\\n\\nNote Psalm 83 where the Psalmist prays against those who \"plot\\ntogether\" against God and His people:\\n\"Cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your Name O\\nLord... Do to them as You did to Midian, as you did to Sisera and\\nJabin at the river Kishon, who perished at Endor and became like\\nrefuse on the ground. \"\\n\\nThe story of Sisera in the book of Judges (Chapter 4 and 5)\\nprovides a vivid example of God\\'s judgement on the wicked. Sisera\\n\"cruelly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years\" and they\\n\"cried to the Lord for help\" Judges 4:3. In response to those\\nprayers: \"The Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by\\nthe sword, and Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot...\\nAll the troops of Sisera fell by the sword; not a man was left. \"\\nJudges 4:15-16\\n\\nThe account then goes on to describe how Sisera escaped to the\\ntent of Jael where she lulled him into a false sense of safety\\nand then drove a tent peg through his temple with a hammer. The\\nsong of victory by Deborah and Barak celebrated the crushing of\\nthe head of Sisera in graphic detail (Judges 5:25-27). And it is\\nthis that Psalm 83 implores God to again do to His enemies.. \"As\\nyou did to Sisera ...\"\\n\\n\\n6. The blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience\\n\\nThe imprecatory Psalms are fully consistent with the Law of God:\\n     \"If you do not carefully follow all the words of this Law,\\n     which are written in this book, and do not revere this\\n     glorious and awesome Name - the Lord your God - the Lord\\n     will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants. He\\n     will bring upon you all the diseases of Egypt that you\\n     dreaded, and they will cling to you. The Lord will also\\n     bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not\\n     recorded in this Book of the Law until you are\\n     destroyed...because you did not obey the Lord your God ...\\n     so it will please Him to ruin and destroy you. You will be\\n     uprooted from the land you are entering to possess. \"\\n     Deuteronomy 28:58-63\\n\\nThe covenant God made with His people included curses for\\ndisobedience as well as blessings for obedience. Deuteronomy 27\\nrecords the formal giving and receiving of the covenant terms in\\nan awesome account:\\n\"The Levites shall recite to all the people of Israel in a loud\\nvoice:\\n\"Cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol - a thing\\ndetestable to the Lord, the work of the craftsman\\'s hands - and\\nsets it up in secret. \"\\nThen all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" \"\\n\"Cursed is the man who dishonours his father or his mother...\\n\"Cursed is the man who moves his neighbour\\'s boundary stone...\\n\"Cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the roads...\\n\"Cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien, the\\nfatherless or the widow...\\n\"Cursed is the man who kills his neighbour secretly...\\n\"Cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent\\nperson.\\n\"Cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of the Law by\\ncarrying them out.\\nThen all the people shall say, \"Amen!\" \" Deut 27:14-26\\n\\nThe New Testament confirms that the inevitable consequence of\\nrejecting Christ is the curse. \"If anyone does not love the\\nLord - a curse be on him. \" 1 Corinthians 16:22\\n\\n(See also: Romans 12:19-21; Hebrews 1:1-3; 3:7-12; 3:1519; 10:26-\\n31; 12:14-29.)\\n\\n\\n7. How can we preach these prayers?\\n\\nThe Church of Jesus Christ is an army under orders.\\nScripture constitutes the official dispatch from the Commander-\\nin-Chief. But we have a problem: those who are called to pass on\\nthose orders to others are refusing to do so. How then can we\\nexpect to be a united, effective army? Is it any wonder that the\\ntroops have lost sight of their commission to demolish the\\nstrongholds of the kingdom of darkness? If the Church does not\\nhear the battle cries of her Captain, how will she follow Him\\nonto the battlefield?\\n\\nPastors are commissioned to pass on the orders of the Church\\'s\\nCommander, never withholding or changing His words. One whose job\\nis to carry dispatches to troops in wartime would face certain\\nand severe punishment if he dared to amend the general\\'s orders.\\nThe pastor\\'s charge is of greater importance than that of a\\ncourier in any earthly army. There\\'s no place tor the dispatcher\\nto decide he doesn\\'t agree with his Commander\\'s strategy.\\n\\nWhen Jesus Christ sent seventy-two disciples on a preaching\\nmission, He told them to proclaim the coming of God\\'s Kingdom (Lk\\n10:9) - that is, to announce that people must submit to God\\'s\\nrule in their lives. Jesus instructed them to pray for peace on\\nany house they approach, assuring them that if anyone rejected\\nit, the peace would return on the disciples (verse 5). But we\\nmust consider what He said they should do if their message were\\nrejected - that is, if the hearers persisted in rebellion against\\nGod\\'s rule - \"But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go\\ninto its \\'streets and say, \\'Even the dust of your town that\\nsticks to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this:\\nThe kingdom of God is near\"\\' Luke 10:11.\\n\\nWhat would be the result of that denunciation? I tell you, it\\nwill be more bearable on that day for Sodom [on which God sent\\nfire from Heaven in judgement for its wickedness] than for that\\ntown (verse 12). Immediately Jesus added curses on Korazin,\\nBethsaida, and Capernaum tor their rejection of His message\\n(verses 13-15). He then explained to the disciples the great\\nauthority He had given them: \"He who listens to you listens to\\nMe; he who rejects you rejects Me; but he who rejects Me rejects\\nhim who sent Me \" (verse 16). This is the fundamental basis tor\\ncalling down God\\'s curses on anyone: his persistent rebellion\\nagainst God\\'s authority expressed in His Law and the ministry of\\nHis servants.\\n\\nWe need to clearly and forcefully proclaim the war cries of the\\nPrince of Peace. Only then will the Church awake from its\\nlethargy and once again enter the battle. If we tail to pass on\\nthe battle cry then a lack of urgency and confusion in the ranks\\nwill be inevitable.\\n\\nLike Psalm 1 our preaching needs to clearly show the blessings of\\nobedience and the curse of disobedience. The eternal truth is\\nthat God cannot be mocked. Whatever a man sows - that shall he\\nreap (Galatians 6:7). The curses pronounced on disobedience in\\nDeut 28:47-53 were fulfilled in detail in Samaria (2 Kings\\n6:2&29) and in Judea (AD 70). The wrath of God upon covenant\\nbreakers is real.\\n\\nThe \"I\" of the Psalms is Jesus Christ. The \"we\" of the Psalms\\nincludes those of us in the Lord Jesus. The enemies are not our\\nown, individually, but those of the Lord and of His Church. The\\nPsalms are ot Christ as Prophet, Priest, and King. They record\\nChrist\\'s march in victory against the kingdom of darkness. As\\nChrist is the author of the Psalms, so, too, is He the final\\nfulfilment of the covenant on which they are based. God will\\nanswer the psalmist\\'s prayers completely in Jesus Christ on the\\nfinal day of judgment. While on earth Jesus foretold the day when\\nHe will say: \"But those enemies of Mine who did not want Me to be\\nKing over them - bring them here and kill them in front of Me\"\\nLuke 19:27.\\n\\nA fatal end awaits everyone who refuses to acknowledge and to\\nobey Jesus as King and Lord. Hearing expositions of these war\\npsalms of the Prince of Peace will remind His people that God\\'s\\nkingdom is at war! The kingdom of darkness is being overcome by\\nthe kingdom of Jesus Christ, a war in which each local\\ncongregation of believers plays a vital part. You must rally your\\nbattalion to put on the whole armour of God, including \"the sword\\nof the Spirit, which is the Word of God \" Eph 6:17. That battle-\\nreadiness also involves \"pray(ing) in the Spirit on all occasions\\nwith all kinds of prayers and requests n Eph 6:18.\\n\\nChrist teaches His army to pray for the utter destruction of the\\nenemies of God as the psalmist did: \"Pour out Your wrath on the\\nnations that do not acknowledge You, on the kingdoms that do not\\ncall on Your Name\" Ps 79:6.\\n\\nTo deal with the very real hurts and injustices in this world it\\nis necessary for us to pray for God\\'s justice. Those who are\\npersecuted need the comfort of these prayers.\\n\\n\"Let the saints rejoice in His honour and sing for joy...May the\\npraise of God be in their mouths and a double-edged sword in\\ntheir hands, to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment\\non the peoples, to bind their kings with fetters, their nobles\\nwith shackles of iron, to carry out the sentences written against\\nthem. This is the glory of all His saints. Praise the Lord. \" Ps\\n149:5-9\\n\\nPrayer is, in fact, spiritual warfare. One weapon is prayer for\\nconversion of spiritual enemies; another is prayer for judgement\\non those who finally refuse to be converted. We handicap the army\\nof God when we refuse to use both of these great weapons that He\\nhas given us. It is at all times a part of the task of the people\\nnf God to destroy evil.\\n\\nIf you have been guilty of dulling your sword, by neglecting or\\nundermining these psalms, repent of that sin, sharpen your sword\\nanew, and go forth to do battle in the Name and for the Glory of\\nJesus - until \"the knowledge of the Lord will cover the earth as\\nthe waters cover the sea\" Hab 2:14.\\n\\nThe full book \"War Psalms of the Prince of Peace \" is available,\\nat R25, from Frontline Fellowship, PO Box 74 Newlands, 7725 RSA.\\n\\n\\nPERMISSION TO REPRODUCE\\nThose wishing to reproduce or quote from any edition of FF News\\nare encouraged to do so.

Both Jainism and Buddhism are atheistic\\nso there is no deity to dispense rewards or punishments.  Karma is usually\\ndescribed in terms of seeds and reaping the fruit thereof.  In fact \"As you\\nsow, so shall you reap\" is found in the Pali Canon as I recall, the metaphor\\nof natural growth is explicit.\\n\\nHinduism, or some sects in that tradition, are I believe much more\\ndeterministic and involve concepts closer to reward and punishment being\\ntheistically inclined.\\n\\nIn point of fact, the Theravadin Buddhist tradition of Southeast Asia\\nconsiders karma as only one of five influences in human life, and in\\nfact from their point of view they would be unable to explain the mechanics\\nof karma without the element of free will.\\n\\nAlso in Eastern religions there is a difference between reincarnation and\\nrebirth, which is essentially absent in Western considerations.\\n\\nIsn\\'t Origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation\\namong Christian thinkers?

I last did this \\nin the Summer of 1991.  I read everything that I can find and then sit down \\nand rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books \\nthat have 217, 237 and 122 pages.  Opposite each page of written text(which \\nI write myself) I\\'ve pulled figures, tables and graphs from various \\ncopyrighted sources.  Since this material is only being used for \\neducational purposes, I can get around the copyright laws (so far).  I can not \\nsend this material out to newsgroup readers(as I\\'ve been asked to do).\\n\\nI am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition \\nassessment lab.  This is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that I need \\nto make my education program complete.  This lab will let me measure the \\nnutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to \\nbe required in humans.  The Mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to \\ndesign supplement programs for their cancer patients.  Cancer Treatment \\nCenters of America, which is a private for-profit organization with \\nhospitals in Illinois and Oklahoma(Tulsa) also operates a \\nnutritional assessment clinical lab.  I also believe that the Pritikin \\nClinic in California has a similiar lab setup.\\n\\nFor physicians reading this post, I would suggest that you get the new \\nClinical Nutrition Textbook that has just been published(Feb) by Mosby.  I \\nhave been using Alpers Manual of Nutritional Therapeutics(a Little Brown \\nseries book) as a supplemental text for my course but Alpers is geared more \\nto residency training.  Two M.D\\'s have written this new Clinical Nutrition\\ntextbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it \\ndoes a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a \\npatient\\'s nutritional status.  Let me quote a few sentences from the \\nPreface of this new text:\\n\\n\"So-called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists, \\nhematologists, or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge \\nof nutrition as it related to their field of practice.\"  \\n\\n\"Unfortunately, about two thirds of the medical schools in the United \\nStates require no formal instruction in nutrition.\"\\n\\n\"But times and medical practice have changed.  More than half of the \\nleading causes of death in this country are nutrition related.\"\\n\\n\"... this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives: (1) it \\nshould complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of \\nnutrition to your medical practice; and (2) it should heighten your \\nawareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important \\nfor both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially \\nevery organ system.\"\\n\\nRoland L. Weinsier, MD, DrPH \\n\\nLida, my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find \\na physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals\\n(yes even magnesium may play a role in depression) play in depression and \\nwho could get a nutritional profile run.  Menopause is often a time when \\nwomen suffer depression.  There are a lot of hormonal changes that are \\noccuring but they are not the same ones that occur during PMS.  A \\nnutritionist may also be able to help.  Not too long ago a poster mentioned \\nthat his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red \\ncell glutathionine peroxidase test(the specific test for the selenium \\nreserve).  Most clinical labs will not run this test and I advised him to \\ntry to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified.  There are \\nalso a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral \\nanalysis but these labs are not regulated.  Checks of these labs using \\ncertified standards, and also those doing water lead analysis, showed some \\npretty shoddy testing was going on.  If you or anyone else finds someone \\nwho will run these speciality nutrition tests, make sure that they are \\nusing a lab that has been certified under CLIA(the Clinical Laboratory \\nImprovement Act).  \\n\\nA diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown \\nto correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging \\nand software analysis(Nutritionist IV and other software programs).  But \\nthere are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not \\nshow a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status.\\nUntil we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the \\nU.S. and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional \\nprofile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses \\ndiet changes and supplementation, anti-depressants will probably continue \\nto be the best approach to depression.\\n\\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\\n\\n\"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is \\nno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n' ------------> sci.med\n",

I can\\'t find any discussion of this problem in any\\nresources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins\\'s\\n_PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors\\' documentation).\\n\\nI\\'m posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the\\nsame article with a test program demonstrating the problem on\\ncomp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures,\\nhence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and\\nare interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program in\\ncomp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach\\nto dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the above\\nGaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)\\n\\nThe problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize \"stitching\"\\nartifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are\\ncoplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line will\\ndiffer slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z values\\nacross an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with\\nvertices of the area.  Because of this, it\\'s a tossup whether the\\nZ-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed.\\nVisually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the\\nline is supposed to be solid.\\n\\nUsing the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly\\ndifferent PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one\\nfor the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate-\\nmode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in\\neffect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  The\\nresult is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as to\\nattempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.\\n\\nThis shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used\\nin the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair \"backwards\" (i.e.\\nsmaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view\\ntable entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformed\\nto NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than\\nif it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.\\n\\nI would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount\\nto a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer,\\ntypically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers).\\nTherefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC\\nbetween the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix\\nthe stitching.\\n\\nBut in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003\\nto 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, it\\'s worst when the NPC Z\\ncomponent of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more\\nor less edge-on to the viewer.)  It\\'s as if only 8 or 9 bits of the\\nZ-buffer have any dependable meaning!  This amount is so great that one\\nproblem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines \"show through\"\\nareas which they are supposed to lie behind.\\n\\nI\\'ve observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital\\nworkstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree.  The test\\nprogram demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation;\\nthis version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX\\n5.1.\\n\\nOpen questions:\\n    (1) Why does this happen?\\n        --  Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly?\\n        --  Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines\\n            as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which\\n            could be corrected for?\\n        --  Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their\\n            interpolators?\\n        --  Something else?\\n    (2) What to do about it?\\n        --  Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision\\n            in Z-buffered HLHSR?\\n        --  Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching\\n            artifacts?\\n        --  Am I just out of luck?\\n\\nAny help would be immensely appreciated!\\n\\n-- \\n===============================================================================\\nDave Gorgen                         Internet: gorgen@ann-arbor.applicon.slb.com\\nApplicon Inc.                                 gorgen@aaaca1.sinet.slb.com\\nAnn Arbor, Michigan (USA)               UUCP: ...!uunet!sharkey!applga!gorgen\\n' ------------> comp.graphics\n",

Since Christians citing the Bible in such a context\\n>should be presumed to have at least READ the story, it amounts to slander\\n>-- a charge that homosexuality == rape -- to use that against us.\\n\\nThe story in Genesis 19 tells of the citizens of Sodom demanding an opportunity \\nto \"know\" the two men who were Lot\\'s guests; the fact that the Sodomites became \\nangry when Lot offered them his daughters could be seen as indicating that they \\nwere interested only in homosexual intercourse.  Yes, what they wanted was \\nrape, homosexual rape, and everybody agrees that that is wrong.  Some \\nChristians believe that the homosexual aspect of their desire was just as \\nsinful as the rape aspect of their desire.  The passage does not say what it \\nwas that so offended God, whether it was the homosexuality, or the intended \\nrape, or both, but I believe that it is only fair to consider all the possible \\nalternatives in the light of related Scriptures.  I do not believe that those \\nwho believe God was offended by both the homosexuality and the rape are trying \\nto say that homosexuality is itself a form of rape.\\n\\nYou seems to take the view that the *only* sin described in Gen. 19 is in the \\nfact that the Sodomites wanted to commit rape, and that it is unfair to \\n\"stigmatize\" their homosexuality by associating it with the sin of rape.  I can \\nsee how you might reach such a conclusion if you started from the conclusion \\nthat there is nothing wrong with homosexuality, but then again we\\'re not \\nsupposed to start from our conclusions because that\\'s circular reasoning.  If \\nGod is in fact opposed to homosexual intercourse in general, then the more \\nprobably interpretation is that He was at least as offended by the Sodomites\\' \\nblatant homosexuality as He was by their intent to commit rape.  Later on I \\nwill document why I believe the Old Testament portrays God as One who despises \\n*any* homosexual intercourse, even if both partners are consenting adults.\\n\\n>>\"... Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolators, nor adulterers, \\n>>nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor \\n>drunkards, \\n>>nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom  of God.  And such \\n>were \\n>>some of you...\"  I Cor. 6:9-11.\\n> \\n>The moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of _porneia_\\n>in this.  \\n\\nThe moderator found my proposal to be circular in that he regarded the church \\nas the proper  authority for determining what *kinds* of marriages would be \\nlegitimate, and thus the church\\'s refusal to recognize \"perverted\" marriages \\nwas circular reasoning.  My questions, however, had nothing to do with the \\nchurch ordaining new kinds of marriages, and so his argument was something of a \\nstraw man.  In terms of my original question, the precise \\ndefinition/translation of \"porneia\" isn\\'t really important, unless you are \\ntrying to argue that the Bible doesn\\'t really condemn extramarital sex.  I\\'m \\nnot sure the moderator was trying to do that.\\n\\nIn any case, I think both you and the moderator have missed the point here.  \\nWhen Jesus was asked about divorce, He replied, \"Have you not read, that He who \\ncreated them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, \\'For this \\ncause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife; and \\nthe two shall become one flesh\\'?  Consequently they are no longer two, but one \\nflesh.  What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.\" (Mt. \\n19:4-6).  I read here that the sexual union of a man (male) and his wife \\n(female) is a divinely-ordained union.  In other words, the institution of \\nheterosexual marriage is something ordained and established by God--not by men, \\nand not by the church, but by God.  Men are not supposed to dissolve this \\nunion, in Jesus\\' words, because it is not something created by men.\\n\\nThis is not circular reasoning, this is just reading God\\'s word.  I read in the \\nBible that God ordained the union of male and female.  I do not read of any \\nsimilar divinely-ordained union of two males or two females.  Granted, there \\nhave been uninspired men who have ordained \"alternative\" unions (isn\\'t Caligula \\nreported to have \"married\" his horse?), but the only union that Jesus refers to \\nas \"what God has joined together\" is the heterosexual union of a man and his \\nwife.\\n\\n(Pardon me for mentioning Caligula.  I know that\\'s probably inflammatory, and I \\nshould save it for the discussion on bestiality, in part 2 of this post.  \\nPlease hold off on passing judgement on me until you have read that section of \\nmy reply.)\\n\\nAnyway, my original question was not whether we should translate \"porneia\" in a \\nway that condemns only a select few kinds of extramarital sex, my question was: \\ngiven that heterosexual marriage is the only union described by the Bible as \\ndivinely-ordained, and given a Biblical prohibition against sex outside of \\nmarriage, is homosexual intercourse sinful?  Of course, I see now that first we \\nneed to ask whether the Bible really condemns sex outside of marriage.  You \\nseem to be trying to argue that only certain kinds of extramarital sex (and \\nother sins) are really wrong:\\n\\n>>I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\\n>activity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\\n>\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\\n>or may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\\n>fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\\n>all \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\\n>in MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\\n>with all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\\n>Christian discussion of ALL these areas.\\n\\nAlternatively, it may be that the definition of such terms as \"porneia\" and all \\nthe rest was, in Paul\\'s day, what we would call a FAQ; i.e. the Law, as the \\n\"tutor\" appointed by God to lead us to Christ, had just spent some sixteen \\ncenturies drumming into the heads of God\\'s people the idea that things like \\nhomosexual intercourse were abominations that deserved punishment by death.  \\nPerhaps Paul didn\\'t go into detail on what \"porneia\" &c were because after 1600 \\nyears he considered the question to have been dealt with already.  Perhaps the \\nreason God\\'s apostles and prophets did not devote a great deal of time defining \\na distinct, New Testament sexuality was because He did not intend any \\nsignificant changes in the sexuality He had already established by the Law.  \\nI\\'ll discuss the Law and homosexuality in greater detail below, but I just \\nwanted to point out that the New Testament\\'s failure to develop a detailed new \\nstandard of sexuality is not necessarily evidence that God does not care about \\nsexual conduct--especially after 1600 years of putting people to death for \\npracticing homosexuality!\\n\\n>Homosexual behavior is no different.

How do \\nyou determine the difference between obsessive sexual behavior and normal sex \\ndrives?  Is the desire to have \"sinful\" sex an obsessively driven mode of \\nbehavior?  I think you see that this is circular reasoning:  Why is it defined \\nas sinful?  Because it is obsessive.  What makes it obsessive?  The fact that \\nthe person is driven to seek it even though it\\'s sinful.  Or is it obsessive \\nbecause it is a desire for that which society condemns?  Once again, that\\'s \\ncircular:  Why is it defined as obsessive?  Because the person wants it even \\nthough society condemns it.  Why does society condemn it?  Because it is \\nobsessive.\\n\\nYou seem to be trying to limit the Bible\\'s condemnation of \"porneia\" to only \\n\"perverted\" sex acts, but I don\\'t think you can really define \"perverted\" \\nwithout falling into exactly the same circularity you accuse me of.

Would you agree that if God condemns homosexual \\nintercourse even among those who are not under the Law of Moses, then this \\nwould show that God\\'s condemnation of homosexual acts goes beyond the ritual \\nlaw?  If I can show you from Scripture that God punished the homosexual \\nbehavior of people who were *not* under the Law of Moses, would you agree that \\nGod\\'s definition of homosexual intercourse as an abomination is not limited to \\njust the ritual law and those who are under the Law?\\n\\nI\\'ve been having a private Email discussion with a 7th Day Adventist on the \\nsubject of the Sabbath, and my main point against a Christian sabbath-keeping \\nrequirement has been that nowhere in Scripture does God command Gentiles to \\nrest on the sabbath, nor does He ever condemn Gentiles for failing to rest on \\nthe Sabbath.  This illustrates the difference between universal requirements \\nsuch as \"Thou shalt not kill\", and requirements that are merely part of the \\n(temporary, Jews-only) Law of Moses, such as the Sabbath.\\n\\nThe point you are trying to make is that you think the classification of \\nhomosexual intercourse as \"an abomination\" is *just* a part of the temporary, \\nJews-only Law of Moses.  I on the other hand believe that it was labelled by \\nGod as an abomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, and that He punished those \\nguilty of this behavior by death or exile.  Here\\'s why:\\n\\nBack in Genesis 15, God promises to give Abraham all the land that was then in \\nthe possession of \"the Amorite\"--kinda hard on the Amorite, don\\'t you think?  \\nBut in verse 16 we have a clue that this might not be as unjust as it sounds:  \\nit seems God is going to postpone this takeover for quite a while, because \"the \\niniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete\".\\n\\nRemember, this is all long before there was a ritual law.  What then was the \\niniquity the Amorite was committing that, when complete, would justify his \\nbeing cast out of his own land and/or killed?  Go back and look at Lev. 18 \\nagain.  Verses 1-23 list a variety of sins, including child sacrifice, incest, \\nhomosexuality, and bestiality.  Beginning in verse 24, God starts saying, \"Do \\nnot defile yourselves by any of these things; for _by_all_these_ _things_ the \\nnations which I am casting out before you _have_ _become_defiled_.  For the \\nland has become defiled, therefore I have visited its punishment upon it, so \\nthe land has spewed out its inhabitants... For whoever does any of these \\nabominations, those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their \\npeople.\"\\n\\nNotice that God says the Gentile nations (who are *not* under the ritual Law of \\nMoses) are about to be punished because they have \"defiled\" themselves and \\ntheir land by committing \"abominations\" that include incest, bestiality, and \\nhomosexuality.  Flip ahead two chapters to Lev. 20, and you will find these \\nsame \"abominations\" listed, and this time God decrees the death penalty on \\nanyone involved in any of these things, including, specifically, a man \"lying \\nwith another man as one lies with a woman\" (Lv. 20:13).  Their \\n\"bloodguiltiness\" was upon them, meaning that in God\\'s eyes, they deserved to \\ndie for having done such things.  According to Lev. 18:26-29, even \"the alien \\n[non-Jew] who sojourns among you\" was to refrain from these practices, on \\npenalty of being \"cut off [by God?] from among their people.\"\\n\\nUnder the circumstances, I believe it would be very difficult to support the \\nclaim that in the Old Testament God objected only to the intended rape, and not \\nthe homosexuality, in Sodom.  Since God took the trouble to specifically list \\nsex between two consenting men as one of the reasons for wiping out the \\nCanaanite nations, (not homosexual rape, mind you, but plain, voluntary gay \\nsex), I\\'d say God was not neutral on the subject of homosexual behavior, even \\nby those who had nothing to do with the Mosaic Covenant.\\n\\n>For those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\\n>be \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\\n>it is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\\n>determine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.\\n\\nAccording to II Tim. 3:16, all Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable \\nfor teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness; thus, I \\nbelieve that even though we Gentile Christians are not under the Law, we can \\nlearn from studying it.  If a certain action is defined as a sin because it is \\na violation of the Law, then it is a sin only for those who are under the Law \\n(for example, in the case of Sabbath-keeping).  Where God reveals that certain \\nactions are abominations even for those who are not under the Law, then I \\nconclude that God\\'s objection to the practice is not based on whether or not a \\nperson is under the Law, but on the sinfulness of the act itself.  In the case \\nof homosexuality, homosexual intercourse is defined by God as a defiling \\nabomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, i.e. for those who are not under the \\nLaw as well as for those who are.  Thus, I am not at all trying to say that \\nGentile Christians have any obligation to keep any part of the Law, I am simply \\nsaying that God referred to homosexuality as a sin even for those who are not \\nobligated to keep the Law.

It provides a\\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\\n  instrument.\\n\\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\\n  the development of custom code.)\\n\\nUltimage Concept VI\\n-------------------\\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\\n\\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\\n  characterization.\\n\\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\\n  be imported.\\n\\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects\\' detection, measurement, and\\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\\n  modules.\\n\\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\\n\\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\\n  hole filling.\\n\\n  The program\\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\\n\\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\\n  707-579-1733\\n\\nIPLab Spectrum\\n--------------\\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\\n\\n\\nMacintosh-based tools\\n=====================\\n\\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\\n---------------------------------\\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\\n  from numerical modelling calculations.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\\n\\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\\n  availlable from Storm Technologies.

Several steps are often required to\\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.

Image Analyst lets users configure\\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\\n  radiographs.\\n\\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\\n  a disk-stored image.\\n\\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\\n\\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\\n\\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\\n\\nIPLab\\n-----\\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\\n  FAX 703-281-2509\\n\\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\\n  integrated image analysis.\\n\\nIMAGE\\n-----\\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\\n  image v3.\\n\\n\\n\\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\\n==========================\\n\\nCCD\\n---\\n  Richard Berry\\'s CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\\n  disks with image manipulating software.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\\n  modules.\\n\\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\\n  ratioing.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\\'s environments. Using\\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\\n  applications programs.\\n\\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\\n  interactively driven through this control.\\n\\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\\n\\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\\n  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The\\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\\n  processing of remote sensed data.\\n\\n  For further information, please contact:\\n\\n  The Business Manager, CLOUGH Engineering Group Systems Division, 627\\n  Chapel Street, South Yarra, Australia 3141.

Been around for\\n  a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000\\n  with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display\"\\n\\nHIPS\\n----\\n(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory\\'s Image Processing System)\\n\\n  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image\\n  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image\\n  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil\\n  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\\n\\n  Feature description\\n\\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\\n\\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\\n\\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\\n  ``filters\\'\\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\\n\\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\\n\\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \\n  palettes can be generated.\\n\\n\\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\\n\\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\\no  image & constant: + - / *\\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

Yes, but not everything\\n\\tis for my good.  No doubt I am free to do anything, but I for one\\n\\twill not let anything make free with me.\"  [1 Cor. 6:12]\\n\\nWhich is a restatement that we must have no other \"god\" before God.  A\\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it\\'s a secondary\\nargument from the \\'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God\\'s messengers.\\n\\nI won\\'t deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\\nthem.  They just *assume* that they know which ones are \"moral\" and\\nwhich ones are \"ritual.\"  Well, I have news for you.  Any anthropology\\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\\n\\nI\\'m dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\\nof the ritual law?\\n\\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\\n\\n>I notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the\\n>verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.\\n\\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\\nmine.  And attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in\\nour culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing\\nus as human beings.  You want to dismiss us, and use the sleaziest means\\nyou can think of to do so.\\n\\nJesus and Paul both expound, very explictly and in considerable length,\\nthe central linch-pin of Christian moral thought: we are required to\\nlove one another, and ALL else depends on that.  Gay and lesbian Christ-\\nians challenge you to address the issue on those terms -- and all we get\\nin return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side-track the issues.\\n\\nChristians, no doubt very sincere ones, keep showing up here and in every\\ncorner of USENET and the world, and ALL they ever do is spout these same\\nold verses (which they obviously have never thought about, maybe never\\neven read), in TOTAL ignorance of the issues raised, slandering us with\\nthe vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can\\nmanage to conjure up, tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great\\nemotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even\\ntaking the trouble to find out what it is.\\n\\nSuch behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen Truth in Christ.\\nWHY, for God\\'s precious sake, do you people quote irrelevant verses to\\ncondemn people you don\\'t know and won\\'t even take the trouble to LISTEN\\nto BEFORE you start your condemnations?  Is that loving your neighbor?\\nGod forbid!  Is THAT how you obey the repeated commands to NOT judge or\\ncondemn others?  Christ and Paul spend ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE more time in\\ninsisting on this than the half-dozen obscure words in Paul that you are\\nSO bloody ready to take as license to do what God tells you NOT to do.\\n\\nWhy, for God\\'s sake?\\n\\n\\t\"For God did not send the Son into the world\\n\\tto condemn the world,\\n\\tbut that the world might be saved through him.\\n\\tWhoever believes in him is not condemned,\\n\\tbut whoever does not believe has already been condemned\\n\\tfor refusing to believe in the name of God\\'s only Son.\\n\\tNow the judgment is this:\\n\\tthe light has come into the world,\\n\\tbut men have preferred darkness to light\\n\\tbecause their deeds were evil.\\n\\tFor everyone who practices wickedness\\n\\thates the light,\\n\\tand does not come near the light\\n\\tfor fear his deeds will be exposed.\\n\\tBut he who acts in truth\\n\\tcomes into the light,\\n\\tso that it may be sh0own\\n\\tthat his deeds are done in God.\"\\tJohn 3:17-21\\n\\nFor long ages, we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from\\nevil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and\\nrejected.

Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\\n  Tgif\\'s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\\n\\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\\n\\ne. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output\\n  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.\\n\\nf. \\'ice\\' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It\\'s a PostScript-based\\n  graphical editor,and it\\'s available for anonymous ftp from Internet host\\n  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12).

This was\\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It\\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I\\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\\n  purpose packages I\\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\\n\\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\\n===================================================\\n\\nGRASS\\n-----\\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\\n  capabilities.\\n\\n  Feature Descriptions\\n\\n  I use GRASS  because it\\'s public domain and can be obtained through the\\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps.

GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  CERL\\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\\n\\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.

Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

Both  families  agreed in  condemning  the Eutychian heresy. Both  families\\nconfess that the Logos, the Second Person  of the Holy  Trinity, only begotten\\nof the Father before the ages  and consubstantial with  Him, was incarnate and\\nwas born from the Virgin Mary Theotokos; fully consubstantial with us, perfect\\nman with soul, body and mind  ($  \\\\nu o  \\\\upsilon \\\\zeta $); He  was crucified,\\ndied, was  buried and rose  from the dead on  the third day, ascended   to the\\nHeavenly Father, where He sits on the right hand of the Father as  Lord of all\\ncreation. At  Pentecost, by the coming of  the  Holy Spirit He  manifested the\\nChurch as His Body. We look forward to His coming again in the fullness of His\\nglory, according to the Scriptures.\\n\\n2. Both  families condemn the  Nestorian heresy and the crypto-Nestorianism of\\nTheodoret of  Cyrus. They agree that it  is not sufficient merely  to say that\\nChrist is consubstantial both with His Father  and with us, by  nature God and\\nby nature man; it is necessary to affirm also that the Logos, Who is by nature\\nGod,  became by  nature   man, by His  incarnation  in the fullness  of  time.\\n\\n3. Both families agree  that the Hypostasis of the  Logos became  composite by\\nuniting to His divine uncreated nature with its natural will and energy, which\\nHe has  in common with  the Father and  the Holy Spirit, created human nature,\\nwhich He assumed  at the Incarnation  and made  His own, with its natural will\\nand energy.\\n\\n4. Both families agree  that the natures  with their proper energies and wills\\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nare united hypostatically and  naturally   without confusion, without  change,\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nwithout  division and without separation,  and that they are distinguished  in\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nthought alone.\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n5. Both families agree that He who wills and acts is always the one Hypostasis\\nof the Logos Incarnate.\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nI guess that adresses your question adequately.\\n\\nAs for your second set of questions, I am afraid they are irrelevant to the\\ndiscussion (at least from my point of view) of Monophysitism. I do not see\\nhow they relate to the topic we are discussing (other than to start an\\nendless Orthodox-RC debate which I do not plan to engage into). As a brief\\nanswer to your questions, the position of the Coptic Orthodox Church \\nregarding the Roman pontiff, his jurisdiction, his infalability, etc.\\nis exactly the same as all the other Orthodox churches.\\n\\nPeace,\\n\\nNabil\\n\\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\\n         /  Nabil Ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /\\n        /  Engine Research Center             /       /   /    /      /\\n       /  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /\\n      /  University of Wisconsin-Madison    /       /   |    /      /\\n     /  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /\\n    '-------------------------------------------------------------'\\n\" ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

The apocryphal books demonstrate\\nthe same categories and forms of writing found in the other scriptures.\\n(In fact, one could argue that the apocryphal \"Additions to the Book of\\nEsther\" act rather to bring the \"unscripturelike\" book of Esther more into\\nline with other books.)\\n\\n: 4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine\\n: Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and\\n: poetic and religious feeling.\\n\\nHave you ever read the Wisdom of Ben Sira or the Wisdom of Solomon?  They\\nexhibit every bit as much \"poetic and religious feeling\" as Psalms or\\nProverbs.\\n\\n[deletions]\\n\\n: How do you then view the words: \"I warn everyone who  hears the\\n: words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to\\n: them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.\\n: And if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy, God will\\n: take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the\\n: holy city\" (Rev 22.18-9)\\n: Surely this sets the standard and not just man-made traditions.\\n\\nThese words clearly were meant to refer to the book of Revelation alone,\\nnot to the whole body of scripture.  Revelation itself was accepted very\\nlate into the canon.  The church simply did not see it as having a primary\\nrole of any kind in identifying and limiting scripture.\\n\\n: It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus\\' attitude. He had no\\n: argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon (John\\n: 10.31-6), and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus \\n: that in the law, prophets and psalms which referred to him - the \\n: OT division of Scripture (Luke 24.44), as well as in Luke 11.51\\n: taking Genesis to Chronicles (the jewish order - we would say\\n: Genesis to Malachi) as Scripture.\\n\\nJesus does not refer to the canon for the simple reason that in his day,\\nthe canon had not been established as a closed collection.  The books\\nof the apocrypha were part of the Septuagint (which was the Bible of\\nthe early church).  The Hebrew canon was not closed until 90 c.e.\\nThe Torah (Pentateuch/ \"Law\") was established in Jesus\\' day, as were\\nthe Prophets (with the _exclusion_ of Daniel).  The Writings, however,\\nwere still in flux.  Jesus does not refer to the Writings, only to the\\nPsalms, which were part of them.  The books of the apocrypha were all\\npart of the literature that was eventually sifted and separated.\\n\\nTo argue that Jesus is referring to the Jewish canonical order in Luke 11:51\\nis weak at best; he is not quoting scripture, but telling a chronological\\nstory.

We had a discussion about the difference between Christianity\\nand Islam. And I was shocked to hear that our bible study teacher\\nsaid that Mohammad was indeed a prophet but of Satan. I said, \"What??\"\\nI did not believe that, because I have some moslem friends who are\\nso kind and  nice, even sometimes I feel I wish I could be like them\\n(in my point of view, they don\\'t sin as much as I do). How come if they\\nwere under Satan, they could have such personalities. \\n\\nTo tell you the truth, I don\\'t know much about Islam.\\nBut I know that they believe in God, they believe in the day of\\njudgement.\\n\\t\\n\\tNow I\\'m  asking you what your opinions about Islam and \\nits teaching. \\n\\nIMPORTANT : I do not want to discuss whether they are saved or not.\\n\\t    I do not want to discuss about politic related to Islam.\\n\\nP.S: I post this in bit.listserv.christia, soc.religion.christian,\\n     and bit.listserv.catholic.\\n\\n\\nIn Christ, our Lord,                           Smile.........\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t       Jesus loves you.......\\n\\tTabut Torsina\\n\\tTORSINA@ENUXHB.EAS.ASU.EDU\\t   \\n\\n[Let me start by saying that this is not the right newsgroup for a\\ndiscussion of Islam, since there\\'s a group for that.  But I suspect\\nthe point your teacher was making was not specifically about Islam.\\nIndeed it\\'s going to be impossible to see what he was getting at\\nwithin your groundrules, since the question of whether non-Christians\\nare saved is at the heart of it.\\n\\nThe classic Christian view, which I think most people believed until\\nthe last century or so, was that Christianity (and of course Judaism)\\nwas the only religion founded by God, and that all other religions\\nworshipped false gods, and came from Satan.  This is more or less a\\ncorollary of another traditional view that no one but Christians (and\\npossibly Jews) will be saved.  This need not mean that there\\'s no\\ntruth in any other religion, nor that all of their members are\\nintentionally Satanic.  After all, in order to be an effective snare,\\nSatanic alternatives would have to be attractive.  Thus they might\\ncontain all kinds of truth, wisdom and spiritual insights.  They would\\nbe missing only one thing -- knowledge of salvation through Christ.\\nIf this is the background of your teacher\\'s remarks -- and I suspect\\nit is -- that means that a discussion of Islam is not necessarily\\nrelevant.  The point is not that there\\'s anything intrinsically wrong\\nwith it.  It may teach a fine code of behavior, and its practitioners\\nmay all be wonderful people.  But if salvation requires being a\\nfollower of Christ, it could still be a Satanic invention.\\n\\nThis is a reasonable deduction from the classic Protestant position.\\nChristianity says that salvation isn\\'t a matter of being kind and\\nnice.  Those are good things, and we should encourage them.  But no\\none is able to do them enough to be saved.  Salvation requires Christ.\\n(Please forgive me for doing this in Protestant terms.  There\\'s a\\nCatholic equivalent to this that has similar implications, but in\\ndifferent terms.)  A religion may be quite attractive in all visible\\nways.  But if it doesn\\'t have Christ, it\\'s like a diet that consists\\nof food that looks wonderful, tastes great, but is missing some\\nessential food element so that you end up dying.\\n\\nLet me be clear that I am not specifically advocating this position.\\nWhat I\\'m trying to do is (as usual) to clarify issues.  Indeed it is\\nnow relatively uncommon for Christians to believe that all other\\nreligions are Satanic.  Most Christians regard such beliefs as an\\nunfortunate vestige of the past.  This is part of a general move\\nwithin Christianity in the last century or so to a non-judgemental\\nGod.  Christians now find it hard to believe that God would allow\\nanybody other than a really rotten person to end up in hell, and they\\nfind it hard to envision that real malignant spiritual forces are at\\nwork in the world doing things like creating superficially attractive\\nalternatives to Christianity.  Whether there is actually a sound basis\\nfor the shift is a decision that people need to make for themselves.\\n\\n--clh]\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

Plus it offers a full range of resolutions, high \\nrefresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.  \\nThe card is available in both 16-bit ISA bus and 32-bit VESA Local \\nbus versions (models 8500 AND 8500VL).\\n        With 1MB DRAM on board, the WINDOWSVGA 24 card offers \\nmaximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate \\nof 72Hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768 \\nnon-interlaced. Both models provide performance many times greater \\nthan standard SVGA boards, yet conform to all current video \\nstandards.\\n        WINDOWSVGA 24 features Genoa\\'s FlickerFree(tm) technology, \\nwhich eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more \\ncomfortable.  the cards also come with Safescan(tm), a utility \\ndeveloped by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen \\nand thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors.\\n        WINDOWSVGA model 8500VL takes full advantage of the speed \\noffered by the new VESA Local bus technology.  Most VL bus cards \\nwill only handle data transfers up to 33MHz, but the 8500VL will \\ntransfer data at the full speed of the CPU, up to 50MHz.

The longer version to which you refer is\\nusually called the \"Western\" version and its main witness is the Codex\\nBezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).\\n\\n7] As far as size, the difference is that in Clark\\'s edition\\n(mentioned above) the book of Acts contains 19,983 words whereas the\\ntext edited by Westcott and Hort (a typical Alexandrian text) contains\\n18,401 words; i.e. a difference of about 8-1/2%.\\n\\n8] To answer the obvious questions, no, there are no major revelations\\nin the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text.  The main\\ndifference seems to \"expansion\" of detail in the Western text (or, if\\nyou prefer \"contractions\" in the Alexandrian).  The Western text seems\\nto be given to more detail.  There are some interesting specific\\ncases, but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.\\n\\n9] The discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the\\nmore authentic has been hot and heavy.  If there is anything\\napproaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents\\npurely the \"authentic\" version, (ii) each variant reading has to be\\nexamined on its own merits however, (iii) the variant in the\\nAlexandrian text is the \"better\" more often than not.\\n\\nN\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

As I understand it,\\nthe hernia is a relatively minor problem, though I do occasionally\\nhave some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it. The Schatzki\\nring, on the other hand, is causing swallowing difficulty. In particular,\\nif I\\'m not careful about eating slowly, and thoroughly chewing food,\\nfood occasionally gets \"stuck\" before reaching my stomach. This results\\nin a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction.\\nFortunately, the food has always managed to pass, but this is annoying,\\nand causes frequent discomfort.\\n\\nMy doctor wants to \"dilate\" the ring using the\\nfollowing procedure: use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach\\nfor any inflammation, then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing\\nsome kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous. I would like to know\\nif anyone out there has had this (or a similar) procedure done-if so,\\nwas it painful, successful, etc. Also, can anyone  comment on\\nsafety, advisability, and success rate of this procedure? Has it become\\na common procedure? I am kind of leery of having such an invasive-sounding\\nprocedure performed for a (currently) non-threatening condition such as this,\\nespecially considering the possible side effects (bleeding, perforation,\\nreaction to anesthesia).\\n\\nThe second issue: for the past 3-4 years I have had a large number\\nof \"extra\" heartbeats. In particular, during the past month or so there\\nhas been a dramatic increase-a Holter monitor recently showed 50 PVC\\'s in 24\\nhrs, along with a few PAC\\'s. (Many days, there are far more than this,\\nhowever-five to ten per hour). All of them were isolated, and the cardiologist\\nindicated that such a number was \"normal\". It certainly doesn\\'t\\nfeel normal. In the past there have also been a couple of episodes of\\nextended \"runs\" of these beats, one of which lasted long enough to cause\\nsevere light-headedness. I am relatively young (30-ish), thin and in good\\nhealth (recent bloodtests were all normal), and do not smoke, use drugs or\\ncaffeine, etc. I\\'m willing to accept the extra beats as \"normal\", but don\\'t\\nwant to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom. The number\\nof PVC\\'s seems to increase throughout the day, and with exercise (or something\\nas simple as climbing some stairs). Also, if I get up after sitting or lying\\ndown for a while, I tend to get a couple of extra beats. Could they possibly\\nbe related to the esophagous problems? Both seemed to develop at about the\\nsame time.\\n\\nThanks for any help/advice!\\n\\n\\n===============================================================================\\n===============================================================================\\n' ------------> sci.med\n",

DeYoung\\n\\nW. Petersen\\n\\n     More recently Wright\\'s understanding has itself been questioned from a\\ndifferent direction.  In a brief 1986 study William Petersen found linguistic\\nconfusion in using the English word \"homosexuals\" as the meaning of\\narsenokoitai.[22]   He faulted Wright and English Bible translaions for\\nrendering it by \"homosexuals\" in I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10.\\n\\n     In a sense Petersen has coalesced Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs into a\\nsingle assertion that reiterates, in effect, the position of Bailey.  He finds\\n\"homosexuals\" unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic.  \"A\\nmajor disjunction\" exists between contemporary thought and terminology and the\\nthought and terminolgy in Paul\\'s time (187-88).\\n\\n      What is this \"disjunction\"?  He bases it on historical and linguistic\\nfacts.  Accordingly, ancient Greek and Roman society treated male sexuality as\\npolyvalent and characterized a person sexually only by his sexual acts. \\nVirtually all forms of behavior, except transvestism, were acceptable. \\nChristianity simply added the categories of \"natural\" and \"unnatural\" in\\ndescribing these actions.  Ancient society know nothing of the categories of\\n\"homosexuals\" and \"heterosexuals,\" and assumed that, in the words of Dover\\nquoted approvingly by Petersen, \"everyone responds at different times to both\\nhomosexual and to heterosexual stimuli. . .\" (188). [23]\\n\\n      In contrast to this, modern usage virtually limits the term \"homosexual\"\\nto desire and propensity.  K.M. Benkert, who in 1869 coined the German term\\nequivalent to \"homosexual,\" used it as referring to orientation, impluse or\\naffectional preference and having \"nothing to do with sexual acts\" (189).\\n\\n     Petersen then proceeds to cite the \"Supplement to the Oxford English\\nDictionary,\"  which defines \"homosexual\" only as a propensity or desire with no\\nmention of acts.  Petersen\\'s point is that by using \"homosexuals\" for\\narsenokoitai, one wrongfully reads a modern concept back into early history\\n\"where no equivalent concept existed\" (189).  Consequently the translation is\\ninaccurate because it \"includes celibate homophiles,. . . . incorrectly exludes\\nheterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts . . . [and]incorrectly includes\\nfemale homosexuals\" (19=89).  Prior to 1869 there was no \"cognitive structure,\\neither inour society or in antiquity, within which the modern bifurcation of\\nhumanity into \\'homosexuals\\' and \\'hetersosexuals\\' made sence\" (189).\\n\\n     The foregoing clarifies why Petersen feels that the translatio\\n\"homosexual\" is mistaken.  Yet is it possible that Petersen is the one\\nmistaken, on both historical and linguistic or philological grounds?  The next\\nphases of this paper will critically examine Petersen\\'s position.\\n\\n                        THE JUSTIFICATION FOR TRANSLATING\\n                          ARSENOKOITAI BY \"HOMOSEXUALS\"\\n\\nHistorical Grounds\\n\\n     A refutation of the foregoing opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai\\nby \"homosexuals\" begins with the historical and cultural evidence.  Since\\nvirtually everyone acknowledges that the word does not appear before Paul\\'s\\nusage, no historical settings earlier than his are available.  Yet much writing\\nreveals that ancient understanding of homosexuality prior to and contemporary\\nwith Paul.  The goal is to discover wheither the ancient s conceived of\\nhomosexuality, particularly homosexual orientation, in a way similar to\\npresent-day concepts.  \\n\\n     Peterson, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs claim that the homosexual\\ncondition, desire, propensity, or inversion -whatever it is called- cannot be\\npart of the definition of the term.  They assert this either because the term\\nis limited to acts of particular kind (Boswell, active male prostitutes; \\nScroggs, pederasty) or because the homosexual condition was unknown in ancient\\ntimes (Bailey; Petersen).  The following discussion will show why neither of\\nthese positions is legitimate.  Attention will be devoted to the latter postion\\nfirst with the former one being addressed below under \"Linguistic Grounds.\"\\n\\n     In regard to the latter position, one may rightfully ask, did not the\\nhomosexual condition exist before 1869?  Is it only a modern phenomenon? Yet if\\nit is universal, as alleged today, it must have existed always including\\nancient times, even though there is lack of sophistication in discussing it. \\nIndeed, evidence show that the ancients, pre-Christian and Christian, not only\\nknew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior, including all forms of\\nsame-sex activity (transvestism included), but also knoew about same-sex\\norientation or condition.  Petersen admits (190 n. 10) that Plato in\\n\"Symposium\" (189d-192d) may be a \"sole possible exception\" to ancient\\ningnorance of this condition.  He discounts this, however, believing that even\\nhere \"acts appear to be the deciding factor.\"  However, this is a very\\nsignificant exception, hardly worthy of being called \"an exception,\" because of\\nthe following additional evidence for a homosexual condition.\\n\\n     THe \"Symposium\" of Plato gives some of the strongest evidence for\\nknowledge about the homosexual condition. [24]   Plato posits a third sex\\ncomprised of a maile-female (androgynon (\"man-woman\"). Hence \"original nature\"\\npalai physis, consisted of three kinds of human beings.  Zeus sliced these\\nhuman beings in half, to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the\\ngods.  Consequently each person seeks his or her other half, either one of the\\nopposite sex or one of the same sex.  Plato then quotes Aristophances:\\n\\n    Each of us, then, is but a tally of a man, since every one shows like\\n    a flatfish the traces of having been sliced in two;  and each is ever\\n    searching for the tally that will fit him.  All the men who are sections\\n    of that composite sex that at first was called man-woman are \\n    woman-courters;  our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex,\\n    whence likewise are derived our mancourting women and adulteresses.\\n    All the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men:\\n    they are incllined rather to women, and of this stock are the she-minions.\\n    Men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine, and so long as \\n    their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be sliced of the male by\\n    making griends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be\\n    clasped in men\\'s embrasces;  these are the finest boys and striplings,\\n    for they have the most manly nature.  Some say they are shameless\\n    creatures, but falsely:  for their behavior is due not to shamelessness\\n    but to daring, manliness, and virility, since they are quick to welcome\\n    their like.  Sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity\\n    these alone prove in a public career to be men.  So when they come\\n    to man\\'s estate they are boy-lovers, and have no natural interest in\\n    wiving and getting children but only do these things under stress of\\n    custom;  they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days.\\n    A man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the \\n    willing mate of a man, eagerly greeting his own kind.  Well, when\\n    one of them -whether he be a boy-lover or a lover of any other sort- \\n    happens on his own particular half, the two of them are wondrously \\n    thrilled with affection and intimacy and love, and are hardly to be \\n    induced to leave each other\\'s side for a single moment.  These are\\n    they who continue together throughout life, though they could not\\n    even say what they would have of one another (191d-192c) [25]\\n\\nShould these two persons be offered the opportunity to be fused together for as\\nlong as they live, or even in Hades, Aristophanes says that each \"would\\nunreservedly deem that he had been offered just what he was yearning for all\\nthe time:  (192e).\\n\\n     Several observations about this text are in order.  Lesbianism is\\ncontemplated, as will as male homosexuality (191e).  \"Natural interest\" (ton\\nnoun physei), (192b) refelects modern concepts of propensity or inclination. \\nThe words, \"born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man: \\n(paiderastes te kai philerastes gignetai), (192b) reflect the modern claims \"to\\nbe born this,\" i.e., as homosexual.  The idea of mutuallity (\"the two of them\\nare wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love,\" 192b) is\\npresent.  Aristophanes even speaks of \"mutual love ingrained in mankind\\nreassembling our early estate\" (ho eros emphytos allelon tois anthropois kai\\ntes archaias physeos synagogeus, 191d). The concept of permanency (\"These are\\nthey who continue together throughout life,\" 102c) is also present.  Further\\nmention of and/or allusion to permanecy, mutality, \"gay pride,\" pederasty,\\nhomophobia, motive, desire, passion, and the nature of love and its works is\\nrecognizable.\\n\\n    Clearly the ancients thought of love (homosexual or other) apart from\\nactions.  THe speakers in the Symposium argue that motive in homosexuality is\\ncrucial;  money, office, influence, etc. . . bring reproach (182e-183a, 184b). \\nThey mention the need to love the soul not the body (183e).  There are tow\\nkinds of love in the body (186b) and each has its \"desire\" and \"passion\"\\n(186b-d).  The speakers discuss the principles or \"matters\" of love (187c), the\\ndesires of love (192c) and being \"males by nature\" (193c).  Noteworthy is the\\nspeech of Socrates who devotes much attention to explaining how desire is\\nrelated to love and its objects (200a-201c).  Desire is felt for \"what is not\\nprovided or present; for something they have not or are not or lack.\"  This is\\nthe object of desire and love.  Socrates clearly distinguishes between \"what\\nsort of being is love\" and the \"works\" of love (201e).  This ancient\\nphilosopher could think of both realms -seaual acts as well as disposition of\\nbeing or nature.  His wors have significance for more than pederasty. [26]\\n\\n     In summary, virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and\\nhomosexuality is anticipated in the Symposium of Plato.  Petersen is in error\\nwhen he claims that the ancients could only think of homosexual acts, not\\ninclination or orientation.  Widespread evidence to the contray supports the\\nlatter. [27]\\n\\n     Biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the contexts where\\nhomosexual acts are discribed adds to the case for the ancient distinction.  In\\nRom 1:21-28 such phrases as \"reasoning,\" \"heart,\" \"becoming foolish,\" \"desires\\nof the heart.\" and \"reprobate mind\" prove Paul\\'s concern for disposition and\\ninclination along with the \"doing\" or \"working\" of evil (also see vv. 29-32). \\nEven the catologues of vices are introdiced (I Tim 1:8-10) or concluded (I Cor\\n6:9-11) by words describing what people \"are\" or \"were,\" not what they \"do.\" \\nHabits betray what people are within, as also the Lord Jesus taught (cf. Matt.\\n23:28).  The inner condition is as important as the outer act; one gives rise\\nto the other (cf. Mt 5:27).\\n\\n     Petersen errs regarding other particulars too.  Transvestism apparently\\nwas accepted by the ancients.   It was practiced among Canaaniteds, Syrian,\\npeople of Asia Minor, as well as Greeks, according to S.R. Driver. [28]  Only a\\nfew moralist and Jewish writers are on record as condemning it.  For example,\\nSeneca (Moral Epistles 47.7-8) condemns homosexual exploitation that forces an\\nadult slave to dress, be beardless, and behave as a woman.  Philo also goes to\\nsome length to describe the homosexuals of his day and their dressing as women\\n(The Special Laws III, 37-41;  see also his On the Virtues, 20-21, where he\\njustifies prohibition of cross-dressing).  Even the OT forbade the interchange\\nof clothing between the sexes  (Deut 22:5).\\n\\n     Petersen is also wrong in attributing to Christianity the creating of the\\n\"new labels\" of \"natural\" and \"unnatural\" for sexual behavior.  These did not\\nbegin with Paul (Rom 1:26-27) but go as far back as ancient Greece and even\\nnon-Christian contemporaries used them.

Dover, Greek Homosexuality (Cambridge, Harvard Univ, 1978) 1 n. 1.\\n24    We are conscious of the fact that Plato\\'s writings may not reflect\\nAthenian society, or that the speakers in \"Symposium\" may not reflect Plato\\'s\\nview.  However, it is assumed that they do, and with this agrees Dover\\n(Homosexuality 12) and other evidence cited below \\n25 The translation is that of W.R.M. Lamb, Plato:  Symposioum LCL (Cambridge:\\nHarvard Univ, 1967) 141-143.  Note the reference to \"adulteress.\"  If there is\\na homosexual condition derived from birth or the genes, logically there must\\nalso be an adulterous conditon derived from birth.\\n26 Elsewhere in the Symposium we are told that it is the heavenly love to love\\nthe male and young men (181c) but this must not be love for boys too young; \\nthe latter should be outlawed (181d-e).  Such love of youths is to be permanent\\n(181d), lifelong and abiding (184a).  Where homosexual love is considered a\\ndisgrace, such an attitude is due to encroachments of the rulers and to the\\ncowardice of the ruled (182d -an early charge of \"homophobia\"?).  In Athens it\\nwas \"more honorable to love openly than in secret\" (182d -an ancient expression\\nof \"coming out of the closet\").  Mutality was present (\"this compels lover and\\nbeloved alike to feel a zealous concern for their own virtue,\" 184b).\\n    For Petersen to label the Symposium a \"possible\" exception to his position\\nis inadequate and misrepresentative.  It is a significant witness to Greek\\nsociety hundreds of years before the time of Christ.\\n27 Dover (Homosexuality 12, 60-68) finds homosexual desire and orientation in\\nPlato\\'s works (Symposioum and Phaedrus) and elsewhere.  Philo writes of those\\nwho \"habituate themselves\" to the practive of homosexual acts (The Special Laws\\n3.37-42; cf. De Vita Contemplativa 59-63).  Josephus says that homosexuality\\nhad become a fixed habit for some (Against Apion 2.273-75)  Clement of\\nAlexandria on Matt. 19:12 writes the \"some men, from birth, fhave a natural\\naversion to a woman; and indeed those who are naturally so consitited do well\\nnot to marry\" (Miscellanies 3:1)  It is addressed in Novella 141 of Justinian\\'s\\nCodex of laws (it referes to those \"who have been consumed by this disease\" as\\nin need of renouncing \"there plague,\" as well as acts).  Pseudo Lucian (Erostes\\n48) and Achilles Tatius (Leucippe and Clitophon II.38) speak of it.  Finally\\nThucydides 2.45.2 has: \"Great is you glory if you fall not below the standard\\nwhich nature has set for your sex.\"\\n     Boswell (Christianity 81-87) cites poets (Juvenal, Ovid), witers\\n(Martial), statesmen (Cicero), and others who describe permanent, mutual\\nhomosexual relationships, even marriages.  Even emperors could be either\\ngay-married (Nero) or exlusively gay (Hadrian), Boswell says.  Scroggs\\n(Homosexuality 28, 32-34) admits that both inversion and perversion must have\\nexisted in the past.  He discusses possible references to adult mutual\\nhomosexual and lesbian relationships, but dismisses them (130-44).\\n28  See specifics in S.R. Driver A critical and Exegetical Commentary on\\nDeuteronomy (Edinburgh:1895) 250.  He observes that the prohibition of\\ncross-dressing in Deut. 22:5 is not a \"mere rule of conventional propriety.\" \\nSee also Dover, Homosexuality  73-76, 144.\\n29  Plato in his last work, in which he seeks to show how to have a virtuous\\ncitizen, condemned pederasty and marriage between men as \"against nature\" (para\\nphosin)(Laws 636a-b;  636c;  836a-c; 838; 841d-e).  According to TEST.NAPH\\n3:4-5 the sodomites changed the \"order of nature.\"  THe Jewish writers, Philo\\n(On Abraham 135-137) and Josephus (Ant. 1.322; 3.261, 275; Ag. Ap. 2.199;\\n2.273, 275) label sexual deviation as \"against nature.\"  Finally,, first\\ncentury moralist such as Plutarch (Dianlogue on Love 751c-e; 752b-c) spoke of\\nhomosexuality as \"against nature.\"  Christians clearly did not invent the\\nlabels \"natural\" and \"unnatural\".

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\\nmanipulations.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\\'ll get\\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.

Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).

In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\\n\\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\\n\\nNeXT:\\n\\nImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format\\nconversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it.\\nImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at\\nsonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are\\ncurrently being re-organized, so it\\'s hard to point to specific\\nsub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that\\ndoes not support JPEG.\\n\\n\\nPortable software for almost any system:\\n\\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\\n\\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\\'s files.\\n\\n\\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\\n\\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\\nor 192.48.96.9).

To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n\\n-- \\n\\t\\t\\ttom lane\\n\\t\\t\\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\\n' ------------> comp.graphics\n",

As far as I can\\nsee from a quick look, the prophecies have \"after three days\", but the\\npost-resurrection narratives have \"on the third day\".\\n\\n>Time of the Resurection\\n\\nMatthew says Sunday at dawn, Mark says the sun was rising, and John says it\\nwas dark.\\n\\n> Who was at the Empty Tomb?  Is it :\\n\\nMAT 28:1  In the end of the sabbath, as it began to  dawn  toward the first\\nday of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.\\n\\nMAR 16:1  And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the  mother \\nof  James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and\\nanoint him.\\n\\nJOH 20:1  The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene  early, when  it \\nwas  yet  dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the\\nsepulchre.\\n\\n>Whom did they see at the tomb?\\n\\nMAT 28:2  And, behold, there was  a  great  earthquake:  for  the angel of the\\nLord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door,\\nand sat upon it.\\nMAT 28:3  His countenance was like  lightning,  and  his  raiment white as\\nsnow: MAT 28:4  And for fear of him the keepers did shake,  and  became as\\ndead men. MAT 28:5  And the angel answered and said unto  the  women,  Fear\\nnot ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.\\n\\nMAR 16:5  And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a  young  man sitting  on \\nthe right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.\\n\\nLUK 24:4  And it came  to  pass,  as  they  were  much  perplexed thereabout,\\nbehold, two men stood by them in shining garments:\\n\\nJOH 20:12  And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at  the head,  and \\nthe  other  at  the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.\\n\\n>Belief that the disciples stole Jesus\\'s body\\n\\nMatthew says the guard was paid to tell this story, but no other gospel makes\\nthis claim.\\n\\n>Appearences of the risen Jesus\\n\\nMatthew says an angel at the tomb told the two Marys and that Jesus also told\\nthem, to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee.  The disciples then went\\nto a mountain previously agreed opon, and met Jesus there.  This was his only\\nappearance, except to the women at the tomb.  Matthew only devotes five verses\\nto the visit with the disciples.\\n\\nMark says that Jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country, and that\\nthey told the rest of the disciples, who refused to believe.  Later he\\nappeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime.\\n\\nLuke says two followers went, the same day that Jesus rose from the dead, to\\nEmmaus, a village eight miles from Jeruselem, and there Jesus jioned them but\\nwas unrecognised.  While they ate a meal together that evening, they finally\\nrecognised Jesus, whereopon he dissapeared.  Returning at once to Jeruselem,\\nthey told the\\ndisciples of their experience, and suddenly Jesus appeared among them,\\nfrightening them, as they thought he was a spirit.  Jesus then ate some fish\\nand honey and then preached to them.\\n\\nJohn says Jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose, in\\nJeruselem, where they were hiding.  He breathed the Holy Ghost opon them, but\\nThomas was not present and refused to believe. Eight days later Jesus joined\\nthe disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced Thomas.\\tOnce\\nmore Jesus made an\\nappearance to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias but again was not\\nrecognised.\\n After telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat, Jesus\\nbecomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them.  They all eat\\ntogether and converse.\\n\\nThe book of acts further adds to the confusion.  It says that Jesus showed\\nhimself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection (thus\\ncontradicting Matthew, Mark, Luke AND John) and spoke to them of things\\npertaining to the kingdom of God: \"And when he had spoken these things, while\\nthey beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud recieved him out of their sight. \\nAnd while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, two men stood\\nby them in white apparel: Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye\\ngazing into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken from you into heaven,\\nshall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven\" Acts 1:3-11\\n\\nPaul outdoes every other \"authority\" by saying that Jesus was seen by 500\\npersons between the time of the resurection and the\\nassension, although he does not say where.\\tHe also claims that he himself \"as\\none born out of due time\" also saw Jesus. 1 Cor 15:6-8.\\n\\n>The Ascension\\n\\nMatthew says nothing about it.\\tMark casually says that Jesus was recieved into\\nheaven after he was finished talking with the\\ndisciples in Jeruselem.

El-Awa (American Trust Publications, 1981).\\n> \\n\\nI reiterate that I would agree with you that there is little\\njustification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur\\'an.\\nIn Islamic history, as well, apostasy has rarely been punished. \\nBelief is considered a matter of conscience and since there\\nis to be no compulsion in the matter of belief, apostates have\\nbeen generally left to believe or not believe as they will.\\n\\nHowever, when an apostate makes attacks upon \"God and\\nHis Messenger\" the situation changes. Now the charge of\\napostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps \\ncharges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person \\nmakes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public\\nattacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, the\\nsituation is likewise complicated. If the person spreads\\nslander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situation\\nchanges. The punishments vary according to the situation\\nthe apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravated\\napostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie\\'s case.\\n\\nThere is a distinction in the Qur\\'an between a formal war situation\\nand being in the situation where someone unilaterally\\nwages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc. \\nagainst the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm \\nto Muslims. Here, a small group or even a single individual could\\nbe said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words, there is\\na clear difference between a formal war situation (where two\\nclearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchange\\nprisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolated\\nindividuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation, \\nthe unilateral attack and the spreading of \"fasad\" that \\nwould apply in the case of Rushdie.\\n\\nThe matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an \\noffensive book (banning the book is secondary) -\\na full set of circumstances following the publication of\\nthe book come into play as well, including the deaths of many\\nMuslims, and Rushdie\\'s (and his publishers) Media games.\\n\\n\\n> Now, I do not believe in _blindly_ following anyone, no matter\\n> how knowledgeable he or she may be in Islamic law.

I believe\\nthat one of the Qur\\'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33.\\nEvery verse in the Qur\\'an has a corresponding \"circumstance of\\nrevelation\" but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the\\nverse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance\\nin which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could say\\nthat all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the\\nMuslims were NOT involved in conflict, should be suspended when\\nthey were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex, real-life\\nsituations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which can\\nall be related to a single, complicated situation. The internal\\nrelationships between these verses may be quite complex, such that\\narriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how\\neach applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task.\\nIt is not necessarily a simple \"this or that\" process. There may\\nbe many parameters involved, there may be a larger context in\\nwhich a particular situation should be viewed. All these matters\\nimpinge on the situation.\\n\\nIn other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur\\'an.\\nThe Qur\\'an asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection must\\nentail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith.\\nIf the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then each\\nperson has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that.\\nHowever, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to\\nthe\\nState, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society,\\nthe dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there \\nare certain minimum requirements of understanding that one \\nshould achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of \\nthese requirements, as taught by the Prophet(S.A.), in a hadith:\\n\\n\"...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating\\nverse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one,\\nand a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate between\\na permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse of\\nMeccan period from a Medinite one, and does not know the circumstances \\nof revelation, and does not understand the technical words of\\nthe Qur\\'an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend the\\nknowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing and\\ndelaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear from\\nthe deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginning\\nfrom the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer,\\nthe disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive,\\nand is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the\\nsubsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the\\ndetailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of the\\nduties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; and\\ndoes not know the joined words, and the words that are related to those\\ncoming before them, or after them - then such a man does not know\\nthe Qur\\'an; nor is he among the people of the Qur\\'an....\".\\n\\nBased on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many Qur\\'anic\\nverses (\"Why should not a company from every group remain behind \\nto gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn \\npeople when they return to them, so that they may beware.\" (9:122)),\\na science of jurisprudence arose. The requirements\\nfor a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on\\nmatters of law and religion) are many. I\\'ve listed a few major \\ndivisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within these\\nheadings.\\n\\n- Knowledge of Arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory).\\n- Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir.\\n- Logic (mantiq)\\n- A knowledge of Hadiths\\n- A knowledge of transmitters (rijal)\\n- Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur\\'an, Sunnah, Consensus,\\nReasoning)\\n\\nThe study of Qur\\'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves:\\n- discussion of imperatives (awamir)\\n- discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi)\\n- discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas)\\n- discussion of unconditional and conditional\\n- discussion of tacit meanings\\n- discussion of the abstract and the clear\\n- discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated\\n\\nThe principles of Application of the law involves:\\n- principles of exemption\\n- principles of precaution\\n- principles of option\\n- principles of mastery\\n\\nThe jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process\\nin pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matter\\nof looking at one verse and one hadith. \\n\\nNow no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a difference\\nbetween blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is\\nclearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is the\\nfamous hadith of the Prophet (S.A.) in which he says:\\n\"The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet, as \\nlong as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures,\\nand wealth of this world.\" The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: \"O Messenger\\nof God! How may we know if they so concern themselves?\" He (S.A.) replied:\\n\"By seeing whether they follow the ruling power. If they do that, fear for\\nyour religion and shun them.\" I do not yet know enough about the Imams\\nof the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies\\nto them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.\\n\\nThe Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as \"The fortress of Islam\". My only\\npoint is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into\\nplay a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is \\ndelineated in the Qur\\'an and hadith. Those who acquire this expertise\\nare praised in both the Qur\\'an and hadith - those who without the requisite\\nknowledge pronounce on matters that affect society, state, and religion \\nare cautioned.\\n\\nThe only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this\\ngroup, is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is,\\napostasy), was wrong. When one discusses something they should at least\\nbase their discussion on fact. Secondly, Khomeini was condemned as a\\nheretic\\nbecause he supposedly claimed to be infallible - another instance of\\ncreating a straw man and then beating him.\\n\\n> Perhaps we should take our discussion to soc.religion.islam.  Please\\n> email me, Rashid, if you think we should do this.\\n\\nI agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup.\\nUnfortunately,\\nI do not have any access to email, so private discussion or a moderated\\ngroup\\nis out of the question (I cannot post to a moderated group like\\nsoc.religion.islam. How about soc.culture.arabic or talk.religion.misc?\\n\\nAs salaam a-laikum\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

When I got to the library last week, it\\nwas with the object in view to look at some articles that have appeared\\nover the last few years, since my previous look at the literature.  Un-\\nfortunately, they had moved the journal back-issues, so I didn\\'t get a\\nlook at the articles I was hoping to find.  I will continue to reserve\\nmy own judgment on _arsenokoitai_ until I have seen the latest scholarly\\nwork, and I can hope that REXLEX\\'s posting may give some meat to chew on.\\n\\nHowever, what I *can* do now, is to point out the methodological issues\\n-- what needs to be shown for anything to be concluded in this matter.\\nIf the article REXLEX posts addresses these issues, so much the better;\\nif not, you will perhaps understand why the problem is hard.\\n\\n>                 James B. DeYoung\\n\\nwrites, _in abstractu_:\\n\\n>this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it\\n>from the LXX of Lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual\\n>orientation and behavior\\n\\n\\t[it is only a minor point, but let me make it anyway; De Young has\\n\\talready contradicted his own prior assertion in this abstract that\\n\\tthe ancient analysis of these issues was concerned with actions and\\n\\tNOT with orientation.  I doubt this will have much bearing on the\\n\\tarticle as such, but thought I should point it out from the start.]\\n\\nThe hypothesis De Young is advancing is that Paul a) coined the word and\\nb) his intended meaning for it was in reference to the Levitical law.  The\\nquestions I wish to raise are\\n\\n\\t1.)  how would one go about confirming the truth of this hypothesis?\\nand\\t2.)  what follows if one accepts (or stipulates, for the sake of the\\n\\t     discussion) that it is correct?\\n\\nNote that b) is independent of a); I consider b) far more plausible than a),\\nwhich seems merely to be a counsel of despair over finding nothing in the\\nliterature contemporary with Paul to clarify this word.  So far as I know,\\nPaul does NOT in general invent words anywhere else in his letters.  Unless\\nyou have an otherwise-established pattern of coinages, it is *not* sound\\nmethodology to assume it -- particularly if he gives no hint in the immedi-\\nate text to \"fix\" the coinage\\'s meaning for his audience.\\n\\nAs yet, the extract presents no evidence at all.  What do we need to confirm\\nor reject the hypothesis? (which, I should say at the outset, I find somewhat\\nplausible; I certainly know of nothing which makes it an *impossible* way\\nof construing this problem passage.)  I\\'m going to set aside for the moment\\nthe question of whether Paul might have coined this usage, to look at the\\nmore tractable question of what it means.  For this there are, in principle,\\ntwo kinds of evidence that can be adduced, internal and external.  That is,\\nwe can look at the text of Paul\\'s letter for clarification or look outside\\nthat to prior or contemporary writings that Paul might have relied on, or to\\nderivative writings that have some claim of access to Paul\\'s meaning.\\n\\nThe single WORST problem with this word in Corinthians is that there IS no\\ninternal evidence for Paul\\'s meaning.  He uses the word totally without an\\nexplanation or hint as to his meaning, save that its inclusion in a list of\\nnegatives implies that it has for him SOME negative meaning.\\n\\nWe are left, as the only \"internal\" clue, with the etymology or formation\\nof the word -- which is indeed the reason that De Young (and others before\\nhim) have associated it with the Leviticus prohibition of men VERBing with\\nother men, where VERB is some standard euphemism for having sex (\"lie\" in\\nLeviticus, \"bed\" in Greek).  One problem is that \"bedders\" (_-koitai_) is\\nnot, as far as I know, USED that way in Greek.  THEREFORE, I offer one\\nserious test which de Young\\'s hypothesis *must* pass or be rejected:\\n\\n\\to  find a body of Greek texts contemporary with Paul (or not much\\n\\t   prior to his day) such that the _X-koitai_ formation implies\\n\\t   \"men who have sex with X\"  [obviously, the \"best case\" is to\\n\\t   find such usages of _arsenokoitai_ itself.]\\n\\nsuch texts would be confirmation that the word *can* be read that way.\\nIt is worth emphasizing that compound words are NOT in general under-\\nstandable by projecting what the READER may imagine by the juxtaposition\\nof the roots.  Existence of such parallels doesn\\'t *prove* the hypothesis\\ncorrect -- but it goes a long way towards making such a usage (whether or\\nnot original with Paul in the specific case of X == _arse:n_) possible\\nof comprehension by his readers.\\n\\nMy \"test\" moves in the direction of external evidence.  If Paul does NOT\\nin his text explain his word (and he does not), then he has to expect his\\nreaders to already know the word (which stands against its being a coinage)\\nor to expect that it mimics word formations that they *do* know, such that\\nthey can guess his meaning without too much floundering.\\n\\nExternal evidence, that is, texts other than Paul\\'s own and lexicographic\\nor social/historical considerations that might be adduced, then come into\\nthe picture.  *If* there are other uses of the word, not dependent on Paul,\\nwhich *have* sufficient internal (contextual) evidence -- or some gloss by\\na contemporary scribe -- to show a derogatory reference to male homosexu-\\nality, or similar _-koitai_ formations used in similar ways, *then* one\\nhas grounds for\\n\\n\\to  denying that Paul coined the word\\nand\\to  assuming that his readers might understand his meaning\\n\\nDo you see the problem?  If Paul coined the word, then he REQUIRES his\\nreaders to share enough context with him to COMPREHEND his coinage and\\nits intent -- in this case that they would (stipulating De Young\\'s guess)\\nunderstand him to be referring to the Levitical \"universal\" prohibition\\nof male-male sex (this, mind you, in a context where Paul has emphasized\\nat least to OTHER congregations (and so one assumes to the Corinthians --\\nhow else to explain 1 Cor. 6:12, and the Corinthians having to be pulled\\nback from overinterpreting their freedom?) the NON applicability of Torah\\nlaw to his gentile converts!)\\n\\nAmong the considerations that make it implausible for Paul to have coined\\nthe word, its first element is archaic -- _arse:n_ is an old Attic or\\nIonic form of what in even classical (let alone koine) times would be\\nassimilated as _arre:n_.  To me, this implies that we are even more than\\nusually needful of external evidence to pin down meaning and usage.  What\\nis Paul doing inventing a word in obsolete Attic formation?\\n\\nAnd if he *didn\\'t* coin the word, but picked it up like the others in\\nhis list as common terms of derogation, then his meaning will be -- for\\nhis readers -- constrained by that common meaning (since he gives no\\nother.)\\n\\nI cannot emphasize enough that Paul DOES NOT TELL US what he means by\\nthis word.  We (and his original readers) are guessing.  They, at least,\\nhad a contemporary context -- and maybe Paul had used this very word and\\nexplained it in great detail to them in person.  But we have no trace of\\nevidence of that, and to *suppose* it is mere fantasy.\\n\\nSo -- we are *desperately* in need of external evidence about this word.\\nAnd it seems to be exceptionally meagre.  That is precisely the problem.\\nI can think of several more or less equally plausible hypotheses about\\nthe word:\\n\\n\\ta)  it was a standard gutter term of abuse for (some or all, maybe\\n\\t    very specific, maybe very general) homosexual male activities\\n\\n\\tb)  it was a term of abuse used by Jews about the awful homosexual\\n\\t    Greeks (which may or may not be consciously associated on their\\n\\t    part with the Leviticus passage)\\n\\n\\tc)  Paul invented the term -- and again there may or may not be an\\n\\t    association with Leviticus in his doing so.  He may or may not\\n\\t    intend the word to have an explicit and universal application\\n\\t    with absolute and clear boundaries.  [Since none of his OTHER\\n\\t    words in that list have such character, this last seems to me\\n\\t    about the *least* plausible of the hypotheses I\\'m advancing.]\\n\\nOf these, I\\'d say off the top of my head that a) is most plausible -- but\\nI still have reservations about that, too.\\n\\nIf the word NEVER appears before Paul, and in later uses has some evidence\\nof depending on Paul, then one can opt for Paul\\'s coining it.  If it does\\nappear before him, he might *still* have coined it being unaware of prior\\nuse (in which case, his coinage is inherently confusing!) but one should\\nnormally demote c) on the basis of any earlier uses (especially if they\\ncan be shown to have been at all common in the places Paul traveled.)  In\\neither of the a) or b) cases, one has to take into account Paul\\'s relation\\nto the community of usage he picked the word up from -- and whether it be\\nfrom the Greek or Jewish communities, Paul\\'s relations are hardly straight-\\nforward!\\n\\nThere is, so far as I have yet seen, little or no external evidence to aid\\nus in selecting one of these (or some other) hypothesis.  Your guess is as\\ngood as mine (or maybe worse or maybe better, depending on a lot of things).\\nBut it remains -- so far -- guesswork.  And I don\\'t know about you, but I\\nfor one WILL NOT equate human guesswork with the will of God.  By all means\\nbe convinced in your own conscience about what Paul is getting at -- as he\\nsays elsewhere on what was in HIS day a major controversy of somewhat this\\nsame character (Romans 14:22-23)\\n\\n\\t\"Hold on to your own belief, as between yourself and God -- and\\n\\tconsider the man fortunate who can make his decision without going\\n\\tagainst his conscience.  But anybody who eats in a state of doubt\\n\\tis condemned, because he is not in good faith, and every act done\\n\\tin bad faith is a sin.\"\\n\\nFor my part, I cannot see any way to resolve Paul\\'s meaning in the use of\\n_arsenokoitai_ without directly applicable external evidence -- and by\\nthe nature of such external evidence, it will never reach to certainty\\nof constraining Paul\\'s own intent.  Paul, like Humpty Dumpty (and me, and\\nall the rest of us) *will* use words in ways that are personal choices --\\nand sometimes leave his readers puzzled.  If that puzzlement leads you\\nto God, it may be blessed -- if it should lead away (as some of Paul\\'s\\nwords HAVE led some people), then Paul\\'s intense communicative effort to\\ncontrive his meaning in our souls may have some regretable consequences.\\nI have always found Paul to be a fantastically reliable guide -- if I\\nread him \"in the large\", if I can see him lay out his position in detail\\nand hammer it home time and time again.  I am much less certain about his\\nmeaning in his many brief and cryptic passages (such as this one.)\\n\\nIn my usual discursive way, I have gone on at great length about the first\\nof my intended meta-exegetical points -- what would be needed to confirm\\nthat Paul a) coined or b) in any case meant the word to mean the same as\\nthe Leviticus prohibition.  My second point is to *stipulate* this hypo-\\nthesis, and follow up what it implies for both his initial readers and\\nfor later Christians.

But if you can contrive\\nto control the action in dreams or do an OOBE, it seems like a morality applies.\\n\\nNow, there seem to be 3 alternatives:\\n\\n1) Dreams and OOBEs are totally mental phenomena.  In this case no morality\\napplies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene', that is, not trying\\nto think about anything evil, or indulgining in overly sexy or violent\\nthoughts.\\n\\n2) Dreams and OOBEs have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane')\\nEvidence for this is that often dreams and OOBEs are sometimes done in\\ncommon by more than one person.  A\\nmark of objective fact is that >1 people report the same objective experience.\\nIn this case, the same interpersonal morality/ethics applies in dreams and\\nOOBEs as does in waking life.\\n\\n3) Like (2), but here we assume that though the dreeam and OOBE environs have a\\nreal existence, a different moral/ethics apply there, and no (or maybe \\ndifferent) moral laws apply there.\\n\\nSo...

Brown Associates.\\n\\n------\\n\\nDenali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics\\nsubsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products use\\na parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Both\\nhave a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of\\npixel processors.  As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantly\\nin performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have \\nsimilar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and market\\npenetration.\\n\\nThere remain, however, several important differences between the KPC and\\nE&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-end\\ndeveloper's dream system with plenty of performance potential and\\nflexibility.  In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two to\\nsixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends at\\na higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedom\\nsystems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors that\\nsupport a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedom\\ndesign treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowing\\ndevelopers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose\\napplications.  Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput and\\nvideo integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Note\\nthat KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not\\nrequire an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features,\\nhowever, will remain much more flexible.\\n\\nThe KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-user's system.\\nEntry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end\\nFreedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream price\\npoints.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because\\nit uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resulting\\nin better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products provide\\nstrong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized that\\nnot all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denali's\\nconfiguration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase\\ngeometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgrade\\nthem separately as needed.\\n\\nBoth companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at\\nworkstation price levels as a way to attack SGI's more expensive\\nVGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to provide\\nthis capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation\\nof textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higher\\nqualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance, however, Denali\\nprovideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications.\\nAside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelism\\nfor texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics\\ndata storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformation\\nmodules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels\\nto obtain better texturing performance.  Kubota avoids this problem by linking\\ntexturing to its Frame Buffer Modules, providing a lower-cost, more scalable\\nsolution.\\n\\nHope this helps,\\n\\nBrian\\n\\nPS This was reprinted without permission.

Any \"stigma\"\\nassociated with children conceived and/or born out of wedlock rests\\nsolely upon the parents--they\\'ve committed a sexual transgression for\\nwhich they should repent. The child itself has no a priori limitations\\non him or her; indeed, the concept of blaming the child for the\\nparents\\' sins is one most Mormons would find appalling; note that LDS\\ntheology rejects original sin, as the term is usually defined, and the\\nsubsequent need for infant baptism (cf. Moroni 8 in the Book of\\nMormon).  Indeed, LDS doctrine goes one step further and in some cases\\nholds parents responsible for their children\\'s sins if they have\\nfailed to bring them up properly (cf. D&C 68:25-28; note that this\\npassage applies it only to members of the LDS Church).\\n\\nAlso note that there is no \"big genealogical book in Salt Lake City\".\\nThe LDS Church has a massive storage facility in the nearby mountains\\ncontaining (on microfilm) vital statistic records (birth, christening,\\nbaptism, marriage, death) gathered from all over the entire world. I\\nmay be misremembering, but I believe they have records for some 2\\nbillion people in that vault. At the same time, the LDS Church is\\nbuilding up an on-line genealogical database. In neither case is there\\nsome kind of \"worthiness screening\" as to whether someone can be\\nentered in. The only potential issue is that of establishing who the\\nparents were, and that would apply only in the case of the database.\\n..bruce..\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nBruce F.

On\\nJn. 1, 1992, the prison population was 709,587. Projections\\nshow a continued increase in the number of inmates, with an\\nexpected prison population of 811,253 in 1994.\\n   The conditions which this burgeoning prison population has\\ncreated for corrections officers is partially reflected in the\\nnumber of assaults by inmates against staff.  Assaults against\\nstaff increased dramatically between 1987 and 1989, and remain\\nhigh.  In 1987, there were 808 assaults by inmates against staff,\\ncompared to 9,961 such assaults in 1991.\\n   The increased number of inmates has brought on the dangerous\\ncombination of overcrowding and understaffing.  For example in Ohio\\nofficer-to-inmate ratio is 1 to 8.4 -- the second worst ratio in\\nthe nation. The national average is 1 to 5.3.  Other health and\\nsafety issues facing corrections officers include AIDS, Hepatitis\\nB, tuberculosis, stress, and chemical hazards.\\n   AFSCME has more than 50,000 members who work in the nation\\'s\\nfederal, state and local correctional facilities.\\n   Correction officers are not alone in performing their jobs under\\nlife-threatening conditions.  Every year, 10,000 American workers\\ndie from job-related injuries, and tens of thousands more die from\\noccupational disease.  Public employees do some of the nation\\'s\\nmost dangerous jobs. Perilous occupations include:\\n\\n   -- Highway Workers - Highway workers are often injured and\\n      frequently killed by moving traffic because work zones are\\n      not barricaded or don\\'t have proper lighting.\\n   -- Health Care Workers - Hospitals have the highest number of\\n      job-related injuries and illnesses of any private sector\\n      employer and nursing homes ranked fifth.  There were more\\n      than 325,000 job-related illnesses and injuries in private\\n      sector hospitals in 1991, up almost 10 percent over the\\n      previous year.  It is generally believed that health care\\n      workers employed at public sector hospitals and nursing homes\\n      have a significantly higher rate of injuries and illnesses\\n      than do their private sector counterparts.  Health and safety\\n      issues facing health care workers include exposure to\\n      tuberculosis and the HIV virus, back injuries, and high\\n      levels of stress.\\n   -- Social Workers - Social workers who work in mental health\\n      institutions are often the victims of assaults and,\\n      sometimes, fatal attacks.  For instance, last October, a man\\n      carrying a semiautomatic handgun walked into the Schuyler\\n      County Social Services Building in Watkins Glenn, N.Y.\\n      and fatally shot social services workers, before turning the\\n      gun on himself.  There are two basic problems.  First is a\\n      growing lack of support services for people who don\\'t have\\n      the help they need.  Because workers are overworked, some\\n      clients are not given the adequate amount of counselling.\\n      Such conditions may cause clients to become more frustrated.\\n      The \"quality\" of the clients is also becoming more violent,\\n      as more are moved out of the institutions.\\n\\n   Nearly 2 million workers have been killed by workplace hazards\\nsince OSHA was passed.  Moreover, as AFSCME President Gerald W.\\nMcEntee explains, OSHA does not provide workplace safety\\nprotections for public employees.\\n   \"More than 1,600 public employees are killed each year on the\\njob, yet 27 states still provide no federally-approved OSHA\\ncoverage for public employees,\" said McEntee.  \"This, despite the\\nfact that public employees -- highway workers, health care workers,\\ncorrections officers, to name but a few -- do some of the most\\ndangerous work in our society.  This year we are fighting for\\npassage of OSHA reform legislation to give all workers greater\\nrights and protections, and finally guarantee all public employees\\nsafe workplaces.  We need the public support to be successful.\"\\n   Government workers suffer 25 percent more injuries than private\\nsector workers, and these injuries are almost 75 percent more\\nsevere.\\n   Public employees were exempted from OSHA when the law was passed\\nin 1970 and today, public employees in more than half the states\\nhave no OSHA coverage.\\n -30-\\n--\\nCanada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario\\n416-629-7000/629-7044\\n' ------------> sci.med\n",

If you would like more info on the ministry,\\nand/or would like to comment on whether you found this teaching beneficial,\\ne-mail to Randy Hunt at rlhunt@hou.amoco.com.\\n\\n\\nLOVE IN THE MORNING  (Psalm 90:14)\\n\\nby Malcolm Smith\\n\\nMoses wrote this prayer at a weary time in the history of Israel. A generation\\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\\nthan God\\'s way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\\nat Kadesh and had God\\' s promise of one day entering the land. The\\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt\\'s gods as He led\\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What\\' s next on the miracle menu?\"\\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men\\'s lives had hung\\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God\\'s glorious\\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God\\'s love is not an emotion\\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\\nmother\\'s love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love\\'s excitement, a love\\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents\\' love is\\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents\\' love. It is a\\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God\\'s love will the rest of life\\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won\\'t\\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses\\' prayer was partially\\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man\\' s highest\\nperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and\\nthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now\\nhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness.

Matthew 18 talks about being thrown into the eternal fire and\\nthe fire of hell. It seems quite clear that there is this place where\\na fire burns forever. From the Revelations passages it is clear that\\nthe devil and his angels will be tormented there forever. From the\\nMatthew 25 passage it doesn't seem abundantly clear whether the\\npunishment of unbelievers is everlasting in the sense of final or\\nin the sense of continual. \\n \\nFrom Dale's question, I come away with the suggestion that hell,\\nif it were short, might be an acceptable alternative to living\\nforever with the Source of Life, Peace and Joy i.e. the \\nunbeliever ceases to exist.

It does seem clear that hell is something\\nto avoid. At a minimum, hell is the state one is in when one has\\nnothing to do with God.\\n\\nIn the Bible, I am not aware of any discussion about the specifics of\\nhell beyond the general of hot, unpleasant and torment. For instance,\\nit is not discussed how (if at all) the rich man can\\ncontinually stay in the fire and still feel discomfort or pain or\\nwhether there is some point at which the pain sensing ability is\\nburned up. If you can forgive the graphicalness, if you throw a\\nphysical body into a fire, assuming the person starts out alive,\\nat some fairly quick point, the nerves are destroyed and pain is\\nno longer sensed. It is not stated what occurs when at the judgement,\\nthe unbelievers, (who are already physically dead) are cast into hell\\ni.e. they no longer have a physical body so they can't feel physical\\npain. What could be sensed continually is that those in hell are\\nto be forever without God. \\n \\nThe Lazarus/rich man parable is told with the idea of having the listener\\nthink in physical terms in order to get the point that some people\\nwon't listen to God even after he rises from the dead.

They\\'re\\ngreat at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not\\nat working out the method itself.\\n\\nAs a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the\\nsimple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To do\\nthese with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks.\\nNow, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, but\\nin doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and program\\nthem into the computer. You can, of course, \\'obfuscate\\' the trick, and\\nwrite the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see,\\nthe trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does\\nthis mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already\\npre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that\\nour brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic\\nmaterial, much of which isn\\'t used.\\n\\nOne way around this is to bring the environment into the equation, but\\n(again, as far as I can see) this still has an air of \\'if you see\\nobject X, then perform action Y,\\' and we don\\'t seem to get anywhere.\\nThe algorithm has to anticipate what it might see, and what\\nconclusions to draw from it\\'s experience.\\n\\nThe other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not many\\nalgorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yet\\npeople survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are\\nside-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also,\\nneurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate -\\ncan an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it\\'s\\ncode?\\n\\nThe next problem is the sticky question of \"What is colour?\" (replace\\n\\'colour\\' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the\\nmaterialist viewpoint is that it\\'s the product of some kind of\\nchemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +\\ndifferent chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, a\\ncomputer won\\'t see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an\\nalgorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an\\nequivalent that doesn\\'t? It shouldn\\'t, because the outputs of each\\nalgorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do\\nwe see colour?\\n\\n\\n>\\n>However, such a view is actually a nonsolution. How should minds be\\n>able to act as observers, feel pain and pleasure and issue\\n>commands any better than the brain? Moreover, how do the interactions\\n>occur?\\n\\nA bit of idle speculation...\\n\\nIf I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,\\nwith two processes acting on it. The first process has been called\\n\\'Unitary Evolution\\' (or \\'U\\'), is governed by Schroedinger\\'s equation\\nand is well known. The second process, called various things such as\\n\\'collapse of the wavefunction\\' or \\'state vector reduction\\' (or \\'R\\'),\\nand is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a\\n\\'measurement\\' takes place, although nobody seems to know precisely\\nwhen that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptly\\nchange the wavefunction.\\n\\nI envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and \\'something\\nelse,\\' which I shall imaginitively call \\'part X.\\' It seems reasonable\\nto assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might be\\nthe wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply the\\nwavefunction. Note, though, that we\\'d need more than U to explain R.)\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'m speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems to\\nbe some link between consciousness and R, in that we never see linear\\nsuperpositions of anything, although there are alternative\\nexplainations for this. I\\'ve no idea how a brain is supposed to access\\npart X, but since this is only speculation, that won\\'t matter too\\nmuch :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in\\nphysics.\\n\\nI\\'ll go back to my nice padded cell now, if that\\'s OK with you :-)\\n\\n>\\n>\\n>Petri\\n\\n-- \\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nKevin Anthoney                                         kax@cs.nott.ac.uk\\n            Don\\'t believe anything you read in .sig files.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

If you want the full document, ask me by mail\\n--Rex] \\n\\n\\n   \"Questions arise as we begin to think about LOGOS and what His inner\\nconsciousness was composed of. We need to clarify the two natures of Christ\\nbriefly.  The divine nature, which has existed eternally, did not undertake any\\nessential changes during the incarnation which would cause a conflict with the\\nattributes of God, the foremost of these being His immutability.  This would\\nmean that it remained impassable, that is, incapable of suffering and death,\\nfree from ignorance and insusceptible to weakness and temptation.  In the realm\\nof the divine nature it is better to say that the Son of God became that which\\nwas not absolute-and in Himself.  The result of the incarnation was that the\\ndivine LOGOS could be ignorant and weak, could be tempted and suffer and die,\\nnot in His divine nature, but by the derivation of His possession of a human\\nnature.\\n     This would mean that both the properties of the divine nature and the\\nhuman nature are properties of the person, and therefore ascribed to the\\nperson. By this reason we can say that the person can be omnipotent,\\nomniscient, and omnipresent, yet at the same time be also a man of limited\\npower, knowledge, a man of sorrows, subject to human wants and miseries.  There\\nis, however, no penetration of one nature into the other.  Deity can no more\\nshare the imperfections of humanity than humanity can share in the essential\\nperfection of the Godhead.\\n     We are not to assume that there is a double personality due to the\\npossession of the double natures.  Christ\\'s human nature is impersonal, in that\\nit attains self-consciousness and self-determination in the personality of the\\nGod-man.  We must now differentiate between the person and the nature of the\\nMan. Nature is defined:\\n\\n\"the distinguishing qualities or properties of something; the fundamental\\ncharacter, disposition or temperament of a living being, innate and\\nunchangeable.\"\\n\\n     Nature is then, in essence, the substance possessed in common, in as such\\nthe Trinity have one nature.  There is also a common nature of mankind. \\nPersonality, on the other hand, is the separate subsistence of nature, with the\\npower of consciousness and will.  It is for this reason that the human nature\\nof Christ has not, nor ever had, a separate subsistence, that it is impersonal.\\n LOGOS, the God-man, represents the principle of personality.  It is equally\\nimportant to see that self-consciousness and self-determination do not, as\\nsuch, belong to the nature.  It is for this reason that we can justifiably say\\nthat Jesus did not have two consciousness or two wills, but rather one.  It is\\ntheanthropic, an activity of the one personality which unites in itself the\\nhuman and the divine natures, being that neither the consciousness nor the will\\nare simply human or simply divine.\"\\n\\n\\n[The quotation given above is not identified, and it\\'s not entirely\\nclear to me what position Loren is taking on it.  Just for clarity,\\nlet me note that the view expressed in it is one of the classic\\nChristological heresies -- monothelitism.  That\\'s the position that\\nChrist\\'s two natures were not complete, in that there was only one\\nwill.  In most cases (which I think includes this example), it was the\\nhuman will that was regarded as missing.\\n\\nNormally people who talk about Christ\\'s human nature as being\\n\"impersonal\" mean it in a somewhat more abstract sense.  That is, they\\nare using \"person\" as hypostatis, not in the usual English sense of\\npersonality.  In this use, the doctrine is called \"anhypostasia\".\\nPersonally I think anhypostasia is just a more sophisticated way of\\ndenying that the Logos took on humanity fully.  However it has never\\nbeen formally ruled a heresy, and in fact has been held by influential\\ntheologians both ancient and modern (e.g. Athanasius).  But the\\nquotation above appears to be going farther than even Athanasius went,\\ninto the realm of the overtly heretical.\\n\\n--clh]\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\\nmanipulations.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\\'ll get\\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.

GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\\n\\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\\n\\n\\nPortable software for almost any system:\\n\\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\\n\\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\\'s files.\\n\\n\\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\\n\\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don\\'t forget to\\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\\nIf you are on a PC and don\\'t know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\\n(If you don\\'t know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\\n\\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\\nprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have\\ntested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.\\n\\nWe have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.\\nCompanies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.\\nWe do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in\\nproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).\\nWe hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with\\nanything that\\'s free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you\\'d like to\\ncontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.\\n\\n\\n[7]  What\\'s all this hoopla about color quantization?\\n\\nMost people don\\'t have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.\\nTypical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display\\n256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n\\n-- \\n\\t\\t\\ttom lane\\n\\t\\t\\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\\n' ------------> comp.graphics\n",

However, I heard an interesting story about Pope John Paul II\\nfrom an astronomer who teaches at the University of Cracow.  The Pope likes\\nto go to Poland for a scientific conference every couple of years so he\\ncan relax and talk Polish to friends and fellow countrymen.  My acquaintance,\\nan anthroposophist, related the fact that Woitila knew about Steiner and\\nAnthroposophy from his early days.  Before he became a priest he was an\\nactor in a dramatic company in Cracow whose leader was a pupil of Steiner\\nand based his acting and directing methods on Steiner\\'s indications.  Part\\nof the work was the study of the basic works of anthroposophy.  Well,\\ngoing to this conference with him a few years ago, the astronomer and another\\nPolish anthroposophist thought they would ask the Pope what he thought about\\nAnthroposophy.  They chickened out at the last minute, but one of them did ask\\nhim what he thought about reincarnation.  The Pope smiled and said, \\n\"Actually there have been quite a few good Catholics who believed in \\nreincarnation,\" and he proceeded to name several from the earliest times\\nto modern times.

The cesarean rate in the United States is the third highest among \\n21 reporting countries, exceeded only by Brazil and Puerto Rico (1). This \\nreport presents data on cesarean deliveries from CDC\\'s National Hospital \\nDischarge Survey (NHDS) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years. \\n     Data on discharges from short-stay, nonfederal hospitals have been \\ncollected annually since 1965 in the NHDS, conducted by CDC\\'s National Center \\nfor Health Statistics. For 1991, medical and demographic information were \\nabstracted from a sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484 \\nparticipating hospitals. The 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior \\ncesarean (VBAC) presented in this report are based on weighted national \\nestimates from the NHDS sample of approximately 31,000 (11%) women discharged \\nafter delivery. The estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were \\ncalculated by applying cesarean rates from the NHDS to live births from \\nnational vital registration data. Therefore, estimates of the number of \\ncesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based \\nsolely on the NHDS (2). Stated differences in this analysis are significant at \\nthe 95% confidence level, based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value \\nof 1.96. \\n     In 1991, there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries, the same rate as \\nin 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 (Table 1). The primary cesarean \\nrate (i.e., number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no \\nprevious cesareans) for 1986-1991 also was stable, ranging from 16.8 to 17.5. \\nIn 1991, the cesarean rate in the South was 27.6, significantly (p<0.05) \\nhigher than the rates for the West (19.8), Midwest (21.8), and Northeast \\n(22.6). Rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years \\nthan for younger women; in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or \\ngovernment hospitals; in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger \\nhospitals; and for deliveries for which Blue Cross/Blue Shield * and other \\nprivate insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of \\npayment (Table 2). The same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries. \\n     Since the early 1970s, the number and percentage of births to older women \\nincreased; however, if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained \\nthe same as in 1986, the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3, \\nessentially the same as the 23.5 observed. \\n     Based on the NHDS, of the approximately 4,111,000 live births in 1991, an \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  1\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nestimated 966,000 (23.5%) were by cesarean delivery. Of these, an estimated \\n338,000 (35.0%) births were repeat cesareans, and 628,000 (65.0%) were primary \\ncesareans. Since 1986, approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have been \\nperformed annually. In 1986, 8.5% of women who had a previous cesarean \\ndelivered vaginally, compared with 24.2% in 1991. Of all cesareans in 1991, \\n35.0% were associated with a previous cesarean, 30.4% with dystocia (i.e., \\nfailure of labor to progress), 11.7% with breech presentation, 9.2% with fetal \\ndistress, and 13.7% with all other specified complications. \\n     The average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days. In \\ncomparison, the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days, \\nand for a repeat cesarean, 4.2 days -- nearly twice the duration for VBAC \\ndeliveries (2.2 days) or for vaginal deliveries that were not VBACs (2.3 \\ndays). In 1986, the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days, for \\nprimary cesareans 5.2 days, for repeat cesareans 4.7 days, and for VBAC and \\nnon-VBAC vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days, respectively. \\n\\nReported by: Office of Vital and Health Statistics Systems, National Center \\nfor Health Statistics, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: The cesarean rate in the United States steadily increased from \\n1965 through 1986; however, the findings in this report indicate that rates \\nhave been stable since 1986 (3). Because there is little evidence that \\nmaternal and child health status has improved during this time and because \\ncesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of \\nchildbirth, a national health objective for the year 2000 (4) is to reduce the \\noverall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary \\ncesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries (objective 14.8). \\n     Postpartum complications -- including urinary tract and wound infections \\n-- may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries \\nthan for vaginal births (5). Moreover, the prolonged hospital stays for \\ncesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs. For example, in \\n1991, the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $7826 and \\n$4720, respectively. The additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes \\n$611 for physician fees and $2495 for hospital charges (6). If the cesarean \\nrate in 1991 had been 15 (the year 2000 objective) instead of 23.5, the number \\nof cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 (617,000 versus 966,000), \\nresulting in a savings of more than $1 billion in physician fees and hospital \\ncharges. \\n     Despite the steady increase in VBAC rates since 1986, several factors may \\nimpede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean \\ndelivery. For example, VBAC rates substantially reflect the number of women \\noffered trial of labor, which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 (7). \\nOf women who are offered a trial of labor, 50%-70% could deliver vaginally (7) \\n--a level already achieved by many hospitals (8). Trial of labor was routinely \\noffered in 46% of hospitals surveyed in 1984 (the most recent year for which \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  2\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nnational data are available) (9) when the VBAC rate (according to NHDS data) \\nwas 5.7%. The year 2000 objective specifies a VBAC rate of 35%, based on all \\nwomen who had a prior cesarean, regardless of whether a trial of labor was \\nattempted. To reach the overall cesarean rate goal, however, increases in the \\nVBAC rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary \\nrate. \\n     One hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by \\napplying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean \\ndelivery, by requiring a second opinion, and by instituting a peer-review \\nprocess (10). Other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates \\ninclude eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing \\nreimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries; public dissemination of \\nphysician- and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public \\nawareness of differences in practices; and addressing malpractice concerns, \\nwhich may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean \\ndelivery (4). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

During May 1992, the Office of Medical Services, Department of \\nState (OMS/DOS), and CDC were notified of an increased number of malaria cases \\namong official U.S. personnel stationed in Kampala, Uganda. A review of the \\nhealth records from the Embassy Health Unit (EHU) in Kampala indicated that 27 \\ncases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from March through June \\n1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991. EHU, OMS/DOS, and \\nCDC conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and \\nidentify potential risk factors for malaria among U.S. Embassy personnel. This \\nreport summarizes the results of the investigation. \\n     Malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case-patients were \\navailable for review by OMS/DOS and CDC. A case of malaria was confirmed if \\nthe slide was positive for Plasmodium sp. Of the 25 persons, 17 were slide-\\nconfirmed as having malaria. \\n     A questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the EHU to \\nobtain information about residence, activities, use of malaria \\nchemoprophylaxis, and use of personal protection measures (i.e., using bednets \\nand insect repellents, having window and door screens, and wearing long \\nsleeves and pants in the evening). Of the 157 persons eligible for the survey, \\n128 (82%) responded. \\n     Risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in \\nKampala. Although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less \\nthan or equal to 15 years (6/32 19%) than among persons greater than 15 \\nyears (11/94 12%), this difference was not significant (relative risk \\nRR=1.6; 95% confidence interval CI=0.6-4.0). Eighty-two percent of the \\ncases occurred among persons who had been living in Kampala for 1-5 years, \\ncompared with those living there less than 1 year. Travel outside of the \\nKampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for \\nmalaria. \\n     Four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who \\nparticipated in the survey: mefloquine, chloroquine and proguanil, chloroquine \\nalone, and proguanil alone. In addition, 23 (18%) persons who responded were \\nnot using any malaria chemoprophylaxis. The risk for malaria was significantly \\nlower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8/88 \\n9%) than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis (9/37 \\n24%) (RR=0.4; 95% CI=0.2-0.9). Twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported \\nside effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason. \\n     The risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  5\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nall or most of the time (2/27 7%) than among persons who sometimes or rarely \\nused bednets (15/99 15%) (RR=0.5; 95% CI=0.1-2.0). The risk for malaria was \\nalso lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening \\n(0/16), compared with those who rarely used repellent (17/110 15%) (RR=0; \\nupper 95% confidence limit=1.2). Risk for malaria was not associated with \\nfailure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the \\nevening. \\n     As a result of this investigation, EHU staff reviewed with all personnel \\nthe need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis \\nregimens. EHU staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection \\nmeasures and made plans to obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets and to \\nprovide window and door screens for all personnel. \\n\\nReported by: U.S. Embassy Health Unit, Kampala, Uganda; Office of Medical \\nSvcs, Dept of State, Washington, D.C. Malaria Br, Div of Parasitic Diseases, \\nNational Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: In Uganda, the increase in malaria among U.S. personnel was \\nattributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis \\nregimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased \\nmalaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-Saharan \\nAfrica. The findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and \\ncontinued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in \\nmalaria-endemic areas -- preventive measures that are also important for \\nshort-term travelers to such areas. \\n     Mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in Africa and in most \\nother areas with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum; however, in some areas \\n(e.g., Thailand), resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness. In \\nAfrica, the efficacy of mefloquine, compared with chloroquine alone, in \\npreventing infection with P. falciparum is 92% (1 ). Mefloquine is safe and \\nwell tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2-year period. The risk \\nfor serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis \\n(e.g., psychosis and convulsions) is low (i.e., 1.3-1.9 episodes per 100,000 \\nusers 2), while the risk for less severe adverse reactions (e.g., dizziness, \\ngastrointestinal complaints, and sleep disturbances) is similar to that for \\nother antimalarial chemoprophylactics (1). \\n     Doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine, but the need \\nfor daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen \\n(3,4). Chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense \\nchloroquine resistance (e.g., Southeast Asia and Africa). In Africa, for \\npersons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline, chloroquine and proguanil \\nis an alternative, although less effective, regimen. Chloroquine should be \\nused for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant P. \\nfalciparum has not been reported. \\n     Country-specific recommendations for preventing malaria and information \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  6\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\non the dosage and precautions for malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens are \\navailable from Health Information for International Travel, 1992 (i.e., \\n\"yellow book\") (5) or 24 hours a day by telephone or fax, (404) 332-4555. \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and \\npertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the \\nUnited States since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than \\n90% reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these \\norganisms. Because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely \\nrecommended for infants, a high priority is the development of combined \\nvaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate \\ninjections. \\n     The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently licensed two new products \\nfor vaccinating children against these diseases: 1) the Haemophilus b \\nconjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate, ActHIB Trademark), * for \\nvaccination against Hib disease only and 2) a combined diphtheria and tetanus \\ntoxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Hib conjugate vaccine \\n(TETRAMUNE Trademark), a combination of vaccines formulated for use in \\nvaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease. \\n\\n                               ActHIB Trademark \\n\\n     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a new Haemophilus b conjugate \\nvaccine, polyribosylribitol phosphate-tetanus toxoid conjugate (PRP-T), \\nmanufactured by Pasteur Merieux Serum et Vaccins and distributed as ActHIB \\nTrademark by Connaught Laboratories, Inc. (Swiftwater, Pennsylvania). This \\nvaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primary \\nvaccination series administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. Previously \\nunvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months \\napart. Previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive one \\ndose. A booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all \\nchildren. Previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receive \\na single dose and do not require a booster. More than 90% of infants receiving \\na primary vaccination series of ActHIB Trademark (consecutive doses at 2, 4, \\nand 6 months of age) develop a geometric mean titer of anti-Haemophilus b \\npolysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug/mL (4). This response is similar to \\nthat of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed \\nHaemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in \\nprospective trials. Two U.S. efficacy trials of PRP-T were terminated early \\nbecause of the concomitant licensure of other Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page  8\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nfor use in infants (4). In these studies, no cases of invasive Hib disease \\nwere detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with PRP-T. These and \\nother studies suggest that the efficacy of PRP-T vaccine will be similar to \\nthat of the other licensed Hib vaccines. TETRAMUNE Trademark \\n     On March 30, 1993, the FDA approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus \\ntoxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) and Haemophilus b conjugate \\nvaccine. TETRAMUNE Trademark, available from Lederle-Praxis Biologicals (Pearl \\nRiver, New York), combines two previously licensed products, DTP (TRIIMMUNOL \\nRegistered, manufactured by Lederle Laboratories Pearl River, New York) and \\nHaemophilus b conjugate vaccine (HibTITER Registered, manufactured by Praxis \\nBiologics, Inc. Rochester, New York). \\n     This vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months-5 years \\nfor protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and Hib disease when \\nindications for vaccination with DTP vaccine and Haemophilus b conjugate \\nvaccine coincide. Based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody \\nresponses to each of the components of the two vaccines, TETRAMUNE Trademark \\nis expected to provide protection against Hib, as well as diphtheria, tetanus, \\nand pertussis, equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other \\nDTP and Haemophilus b vaccines. \\n     The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that \\nall infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed Haemophilus b \\nconjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12-\\n15 months (5). The ACIP also recommends that all infants receive a four-dose \\nprimary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2, \\n4, 6, and 15-18 months of age, and a booster dose at 4-6 years (6-8). A \\ncomplete statement regarding recommendations for use of ActHIB Trademark and \\nTETRAMUNE Trademark is being developed. \\n\\nReported by: Office of Vaccines Research and Review, Center for Biologics \\nEvaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration.

An international steering committee and scientific \\nprogram committee provided guidance. \\n     The conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries, including \\nAsia, Africa, Europe, Central America, South America, as well as the United \\nStates and Canada.  Support tor the workshop was provided by the National \\nInstitute of Dental Research, the National Cancer Institute, the National \\nInstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH Office of AIDS Research, \\nand the Procter and Gamble Company. \\n     Among the topics discussed were: the epidemiology of HIV lesions; ethics, \\nprofessional responsibility, and public policy; occupational issues; provision \\nof oral care to the HIV-positive population; salivary HIV transmission and \\nmucosal immunity; opportunistic infections; pediatric HIV infection; and \\nwomen\\'s issues. \\n\\n                                Recommendations\\n\\n     Recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association \\nbetween the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of HIV, to \\nestablish a universal terminology for HIV-associated oral lesions, to look for \\nmore effective treatments for oral manifestations, to expand molecular biology \\nstudies to understand the relationship between HIV infection and common oral \\nlesions, and to study the effects of HIV therapy on oral lesions. \\n\\n                                 Epidemiology\\n\\n     Since the First International Workshop on Oral Manifestations of HIV \\nInfection was convened five years ago, the epidemiology of HIV infection has \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 11\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nradically changed.  In 1988, HIV infection was detected and reported largely \\nin homosexual and bisexual males, intravenous drug users, and hemophiliacs.  \\nToday, more HIV infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in \\nchildren and adolescents. \\n     While the predominant impact of HIV infection has been felt in Africa, a \\nmajor increase in infection rate is being seen in Southeast Asia as well.  \\nFive hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more \\nare appearing all the time. \\n     Researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions \\nsuch as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis.  They also are beginning to explore \\nthe relationships between specific oral lesions and HIV disease progression \\nand prognosis. \\n\\n                            Social/political Issues\\n\\n     Discussion on the social and political implications of HIV infection \\nfocused on changing the public\\'s attitude that AIDS is retribution for \\nindiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use.  Speakers also addressed health \\ncare delivery for HIV-infected patients, and the need to educate the public \\nabout what AIDS is, and how it is acquired. \\n\\n                          Saliva and Salivary Glands\\n\\n     Conference speakers described transmission issues and the HIV-inhibitory \\nactivity of saliva, the strength of which varies among the different salivary \\nsecretions.  Whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular \\nsecretions, which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid \\nsecretions.  Research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible \\nfor salivary inhibitory activity.  They attributed the HIV-inhibitory effect \\nof saliva to the 1) aggregation/agglutination of HIV by saliva, which may both \\npromote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell, and 2) \\ndirect effects on the virus or target cells. \\n     Other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease \\nin HIV-infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity. \\n\\n                               Pediatric Issues\\n\\n     Pediatric AIDS recently has emerged as an area of intense interest.

A week ago, I managed to find time to consult\\na Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library,\\nand I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love as\\nused in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of the\\nJewish scriptures.\\n\\nThe principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal\\nnoun from _erao:_, _eraste:s_ meaning \"lover.\"  This cluster occurs just\\nwhere one might most expect it, in the propethic image (and accusation)\\nof Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH.  The verses in question are Hosea\\n2:5,7 & 10; Jeremiah 4:30, 22:20 & 22; Lamentations 1:19; and Ezekiel\\n16:33, 36 &37 and 23:5, 9 & 22.\\n\\n\\t[ Hosea seems to have originated this usage, which Jeremiah and\\n\\t  Ezekiel picked up;  Lamentations is dependent on, though not\\n\\t  likely written by, Jeremiah. ]\\n\\nThe \"erotic\" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) is\\nevident.  So too in English, unless you complement it with a phrase like\\n\"of the arts\" the word \"lover\" is going to have an overtone of sexual\\nrelationship.  There is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to see\\nthat standard Greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the\\nHebrew! :-)\\n\\nMore interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine\\nusage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say),\\n_eromai_ (ask), there is an error in Codex Vaticanus (normally, a very\\nvaluable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurd\\ncontext -- 2 Samuel 20:18, where the  meaning *must* be \"say.\"\\n\\nIn addition to the above (and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs),\\nEsther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application, \\n\\n\\tkai e:rasthe\" ho basileus Esthe:r  --  and the King loved Esther\\n\\nand, rather more interestingly, 1 Samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree of\\nsupport to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan:\\n\\n\\tkai Io:nathan huios Saoul e:[i]reito ton Dauid sphodra\\n\\t-- and Jonathan, Saul\\'s son, loved David intensely\\n\\n\\t[ I\\'m using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which I\\n\\t  don\\'t yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for. ]\\n\\n(The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about\\nthe \"historical\" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation of\\nthe Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the\\n\"erotic\" verb in this context.

It states\\nclearly that the visitors were angels.  But \"all the men from every\\npart of the city of Sodom--both young and old--surrounded the\\nhouse.  They called to Lot, `Where are the *men* who came to \\nyou tonight?  Bring them out to us so that we can have sex \\nwith them.\\' \" \\n\\nFor the rest of the story the angels are referred to by the men\\nof Sodom and by Lot as *men*.  Furthermore we know from Gen 18:20,21\\nthat the Lord had already found Sodom guilty of grievous sin--before\\nthe angels visited the city.  It is clear that the grievous sin\\nof Sodom and Gomorrah involved homosexual sex.  It appears that\\nthe men had become so inflamed in their lust that they had\\ngroup orgies in the public square--which simply indicates \\nthe extremity of their depravity.  It does not show that lesser \\ndegrees of homosexuality are not sinful, as Michael would have us\\nbelieve.\\n\\nUltimately our understanding of God\\'s will for sexuality comes from\\nthe creation story--not solely on the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.  He\\ncreated us male and female, and instituted marriage as a relationship\\nbetween one male and one female, \"Therefore a man will leave his\\nfather and mother, and be united with his wife, and they will become\\none flesh.\"  This marriage relationship is the only sexual\\nrelationship which God blesses and sanctions. He regulates and\\nprotects the marriage of man and woman, and even uses it as a picture\\nof the relationship between himself and his church.  But we find not\\none word of blessing or regulation for a sexual relationship between \\ntwo men, or between two women.\\n\\nEverything else that we find in the Bible about sexuality derives from\\nor expresses God\\'s will in instituting and blessing marriage.  Thus\\nthe Levitical code, which was given only to the Jews, forbade incest,\\nhomosexuality, bestiality; the Ten Commandments forbade adultery and\\nthe coveting of our neighbor\\'s wife; other commandments forbade rape.\\nThe men of Sodom and Gomorrah were regarded as sexually immoral and\\nperverse (Jude 7) because they abandoned and/or polluted the marriage\\nrelationship.

This is a frequently asked question, so I do not post the\\nquestion each time it occurs.  Rather this is an attempt to summarize\\nthe postings we get when we have a discussion.  It summarizes\\narguments for allowing Christian homosexuality, since most people\\nasking the question already know the arguments against it.  The most\\ncommon -- but not the only -- question dealt with herein is \"how can a\\nChristian justify being a homosexual, given what the Bible says about\\nit?\"\\n\\nFirst, on the definition of \\'homosexual\\'.  Many groups believe that\\nthere is a homosexual \"orientation\", i.e. a sexual attraction to\\nmembers of the same sex.  This is distinguished from actual homosexual\\nsexual activity.  Homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered by\\nmost groups to be acceptable.  However in a lot of discussion, the\\nterm \\'homosexual\\' means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex.\\nThis is generally not accepted outside the most \\'liberal\\' groups.  In\\nthis paper I\\'m going to use \\'homosexual\\' as meaning a person engaging\\nin sexual acts with another of the same sex.  I haven\\'t heard of any\\nBiblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who\\nremains celebate.\\n\\nI think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to be\\nhomosexual.  This is often called a \\'homosexual orientation\\'.  It is\\nnot known whether it is genetic or environmental.  There is evidence\\nsuggesting each.  The best evidence I\\'ve seen is that homosexuality is\\nnot a single phenomenon, but has a number of different causes.  One of\\nthem is probably genetic.  There are several groups that try to help\\npeople move from being homosexual to heterosexual.  The best-known is\\nExodus International\".  The reports I\\'ve seen (and I haven\\'t read the\\ndetailed literature, just the summary in the minority opinion to the\\nPresbyterian Church\\'s infamous report on human sexuality) suggest that\\nthese programs have very low success rates, and that there are\\nquestions about how real even the successes are.  But there certainly\\nare people who say they have converted.  However this issue is not as\\nimportant as it sounds.  Those who believe homosexuality is wrong\\nbelieve it is intrinsically wrong, defined as such by God.  The fact\\nthat it\\'s hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevant\\nthan the fact that it\\'s hard to escape from being a drug addict.  If\\nit\\'s wrong, it\\'s wrong.  It may affect how we deal with people though.\\nIf it\\'s very difficult to change, this may tend to make us more\\nwilling to forgive it.\\n\\nOne more general background issue: It\\'s common to quote a figure that\\n10% of the population is homosexual.  I asked one of our experts where\\nthis came from.  Here\\'s his response: Kinsey (see below) is the source\\nof the figure 10 percent.  He defines sexuality by behavior, not by\\norientation, and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero (completely\\nheterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual).  According to Kinsey,\\none-third of all male adults have had at least one experience of\\norgasm homosexually post puberty.  Ten percent of all adult males have\\nmost of their experiences of homosexually.  That was in 1948.  The\\npercentages held true in a followup study done by the Kinsey\\nInstitute, based on data in the early seventies but not published\\nuntil the early 80s or so, by Bell and Weinberg, I believe.  I can\\'t\\nput my hand on this latter reference, but here is the online\\ninformation for Kinsey\\'s own study as it appears in IRIS, the catalog\\nat Rutgers:\\n   AUTHOR Kinsey, Alfred Charles, 1894-1956.\\n    TITLE Sexual behavior in the human male [by] Alfred C.

A\\njournalist is running the rounds of talk shows this season promoting\\nher book that allegedly refutes Kinsey\\'s study, but the scholarly\\nworld seems to take her for a kook......\\n\\nI\\'ve seen some objections to the Kinsey\\'s study, but not in enough\\ndetail to include here.  (If someone would like to contribute another\\nview, I\\'d be willing to include it.)\\n\\nMost Christians believe homosexuality (at least genital sex) is wrong.\\nNot all, however.  A few denominations accept it.  The Metropolitan\\nCommunity Churches is the best-known -- it was formed specifically to\\naccept homosexuals.  However the United Church of Christ also allows\\nit, and I think a couple of other groups may as well.  The Episcopal\\nChurch seems to accept it some areas but not others.  In churches that\\nhave congregational government, you\\'ll find a few congregations that\\naccept it (even among Southern Baptists, though the number is probably\\nonly one or two congregations).  But these are unusual -- few churches\\npermit homosexual church leaders.  How carefully they enforce this is\\nanother issue.  I don\\'t have any doubt that there are homosexual\\npastors of just about every denomination, some more open than others.\\n\\nAs to the arguments over the Biblical and other issues, here\\'s an\\nattempt to summarize the issues:\\n\\nThe most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance of\\nhomosexuality in previous discussions has been John Boswell:\\n\"Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality\", U Chicago Press,\\n1980.\\n\\nThe argument against is pretty clear.  There are several explicit laws\\nin the OT, e.g. Leviticus 20:13, and in Rom 1 Paul seems pretty negative on\\nhomosexuality.  Beyond these references, there are some debates.  Some\\npassages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant.  E.g.\\nthe sin which the inhabitants of Sodom proposed to carry out was\\nhomosexual *rape*, not homosexual activity between consenting adults.\\n(There\\'s even some question whether it was homosexual, since the\\nentities involved were angels.)  It was particularly horrifying\\nbecause it involved guests, and the responsibility towards guests in\\nthat culture was very strong.  (This is probably the reason Lot\\noffered his daughter -- it was better to give up his daughter than to\\nallow his guests to be attacked.)  If you look through a concordance\\nfor references to Sodom elsewhere in the Bible, you\\'ll see that few\\nseem to imply that homosexuality was their sin.  There\\'s a Jewish\\ninterpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests.  At any\\nrate, there\\'s no debate that homosexual *rape* is wrong.\\n\\nI do not discuss Leviticus because the law there is part of a set\\nof laws that most Christians do not consider binding.  So unless NT\\njustification can be found, Lev. alone would not settle the issue.\\n\\nThe NT references are all in Paul\\'s letters.  A number of the\\nreferences from Paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairly\\nvague.  Boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do not\\nmean homosexual.  Here\\'s what he says: The two Greek words that appear\\nin the lists (i.e. I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10) are /malakos/ and\\n/arsenokoitai/.  Unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the words\\nactually mean.  /malakos/, with a basic meaning of soft, has a variety\\nof metaphorical meanings in ethical writing.  Boswell suggests\\n\"wanton\" as a likely equivalent.  He also reports that the unanimous\\ninterpretation of the Church, including Greek-speaking Christians, was\\nthat in this passage it referred to masturbation, a meaning that has\\nvanished only in the 20th Cent., as that practice has come to be less\\nfrowned-upon.  (He cites references as late as the 1967 edition of the\\nCatholic Encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation.)  He\\ntranslates /arsenokotai/ as male prostitute, giving evidence that none\\nof the church fathers understood the term as referring to\\nhomosexuality in general.  A more technical meaning, suggested by the\\nearly Latin translations, would be \"active mode homosexual male\\nprostitute\", but in his view Paul did not intend it so technically.\\n\\nFor a more conservative view, I consulted Gordon Fee\\'s commentary on I\\nCor.  He cites evidence that /malakos/ often meant effeminate.\\nHowever Boswell warns us that in Greek culture effeminate is not\\nnecessarily synonymous with homosexual, though it may be associated\\nwith some kinds of homosexual behavior.  Given what Boswell and Fee\\nsay taken together, I suspect that the term is simply not very\\ndefinite, and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases, it\\nisn\\'t a general term for homosexuality.  While Fee argues against\\nBoswell with /arsenokotai/ as well, he ends up suggesting a\\ntranslation that seems essentially the same.  The big problem with it\\nis that the word is almost never used.  Paul\\'s writing is the first\\noccurence.  The fact that the word is clearly composed of \"male\" and\\n\"f**k\" unfortunately doesn\\'t quite tell us the meaning, since it\\ndoesn\\'t tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the\\naction.  Examples of compound words formed either way can be given.\\nIn theory it could refer to rapists, etc.  It\\'s dangerous to base\\nmeaning purely on etymology, or you\\'ll conclude that \"goodbye\" is a\\nreligious expression because it\\'s based on \"God by with ye\".  However\\nsince Boswell, Fee, and NIV seem to agree on \"homosexual male\\nprostitute\", that seems as good a guess as any.  Note that this\\ntranslation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however (something\\nwhich Fee and Boswell agree on, but do not attempt to reproduce in\\ntheir translation).\\n\\nIn my opinion, the strongest NT reference to homosexuality is Romans\\n1.  Boswell points out that Rom 1 speaks of homosexuality as something\\nthat happened to people who were naturally heterosexual, as a result\\nof their corruption due to worshipping false gods.  One could argue\\nthat this is simply an example: that if a homosexual worshipped false\\ngods, he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become\\nheterosexual.  However I find this argument somewhat forced, and in\\nfact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this is\\nwhat Paul meant.\\n\\nHowever I am not convinced that Rom 1 is sufficient to create a law\\nagainst homosexuality for Christians.  What Paul is describing in Rom\\n1 is not homosexuality among Christians -- it\\'s homosexuality that\\nappeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness.\\nDespite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric, I\\'m sure Paul\\ndoes not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex.\\nGiven his description of their situation, I rather assume that their\\nheterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless.  So yes, I do\\nbelieve that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality.\\nBut in all fairness, the \"shameless\" nature of their acts is a\\nreflection of the general spiritual state of the people, and not a\\nspecific feature of homosexuality.\\n\\nMy overall view of the situation is the following: I think we have\\nenough evidence to be confident that Paul disapproved of\\nhomosexuality.  Rom 1 seems clear.  While I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 are\\nnot unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality, they do\\nnot seem like wording that would come from someone who approved of\\nhomosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases.  On the\\nother hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the\\nsubject.  Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexuality\\nin passing.\\n\\nThe result of this situation is that people interpret these passages\\nin light of their general approach to Scripture.  For those who look\\nto Scripture for laws about issues such as this, it not surprising\\nthat they would consider these passages to be NT endorsement of the OT\\nprohibition.  For those whose approach to the Bible is more liberal,\\nit is not surprising that they regard Paul\\'s negative view of\\nhomosexuality as something that he took from his Jewish upbringing\\nwithout any serious reexamination in the light of the Gospel.  As\\nreaders of this group know by now, the assumptions behind these\\napproaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at the\\nmouth when they see the opposing view described.  There\\'s not a lot I\\ncan do as moderator about such a situation.\\n\\nA number of discussions in the past centered around the sort of\\ndetailed exegesis of texts that is described above.  However in fact\\nI\\'m not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base their\\nown beliefs on such analyses.  The real issue seems to rest on the\\nquestion of whether Paul\\'s judgement should apply to modern\\nhomosexuality.\\n\\nOne commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds\\nof questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality\\nonly in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was\\nwrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act\\n\"straight\" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying\\nto define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian\\nideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the\\nrelationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul\\'s\\njudgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make\\njudgements on these questions.\\n\\nAnother is the following: In Paul\\'s time homosexuality was associated\\nwith a number of things that Christians would not find acceptable.  It\\nwas part of temple prostitution.  Among private citizens, it often\\noccured between adults and children or free people and slaves.  I\\'m\\nnot in a position to say that it always did, but there are some\\nreasons to think so.  The ancients distinguished between the active\\nand passive partner.  It was considered disgraceful for a free adult\\nto act as the passive partner.  (This is the reason that an active\\nmode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful.  His\\ncustomers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role.)  This\\nsupports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between two\\nfree adult males, at least not without some degree of scandal.\\nClearly Christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children,\\nslaves, or others who are not in a position to be fully responsible\\npartners.  (However Fee\\'s commentary on I Cor cites some examples from\\nancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involve\\nfree adults in a reasonably symmetrical way.  Thus the considerations\\nin this paragraph shouldn\\'t be pushed too far.  Homosexuality may have\\nbeen discredited for Jews by some of these associations, but there\\nsurely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did not\\ninvolve slaves or children.)\\n\\nSome people have argued that AIDS is a judgement against\\nhomosexuality.  I\\'d like to point out that AIDS is transmitted by\\npromiscuous sex, both homosexual and heterosexual.  Someone who has a\\nhomosexual relationship that meets Christian criteria for marriage is\\nnot at risk for AIDS.\\n\\nNote that there is good reason from Paul\\'s general approach to doubt\\nthat he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative,\\napart from any specific statements on homosexuality.  I believe his\\nuse of the Genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual\\nmarriage as what God ordained.\\n\\nHowever the way Paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warning\\nagainst being too quick to deal with this issue legally.\\n\\nI claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is\\nnot entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Paul\\'s\\ntendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating\\nholidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues\\nto look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to\\navoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging.\\nFor example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat\\nmeat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about\\nwhich they had personal qualms.  For another example, Paul obviously\\nwould have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances)\\nremain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly\\nwould rather see them married than in a state where they might be\\ntempted to fornication.\\n\\nI believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the\\nviews Paul expressed in Rom 1.  One may believe that homosexuality is\\nnot what God intended, that it occured as a result of sin, but still\\nconclude that at times we have to live with it.  Note that in the\\ncreation story work enters human life as a result of sin.  This\\ndoesn\\'t mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved.  The\\nquestion is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinful\\nor whether you believe that it\\'s a misfortune that is in a broad sense\\ndue to human sinfulness.  If you\\'re willing to consider the latter\\napproach, then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is more\\ndamage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it.\\nThe dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often\\nfails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from\\npsychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when\\nattempts at living as a heterosexual fail.\\n\\nThis is going to depend upon one\\'s assessment of the inherent nature\\nof homosexuality.  If you believe it is a very serious wrong, then you\\nmay be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it.\\nClearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency\\nto steal or with drug addiction, even though attempts to cure these\\nconditions are also very difficult.  However these conditions are\\nintrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious for\\nhomosexuality.  (Many problems associated with homosexuality are\\nactually problems of promiscuity, not homosexuality.  This includes\\nAIDS.  I take for granted that the only sort of homosexual\\nrelationships a Christian would consider allowing would be equivalent\\nto Christian heterosexual relationships.)\\n\\nIn the course of discussing this over the last decade or so, we\\'ve\\nheard a lot of personal testimony from fellow Christians who are in\\nthis situation.  I\\'ve also seen summaries of various research and the\\nresults of various efforts for \"conversion\".  (Aside from the\\nPresbyterian report mentioned above, there\\'s an FAQ that summarizes\\nour readers\\' reports on this question.)  The evidence is that\\nlong-term success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on a\\npar with healing miracles.  The danger in advising Christians to\\ndepend upon such a change is clear: When \"conversion\" doesn\\'t happen,\\nwhich is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feeling\\nexcluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement\\nof life-long celibacy.  Paul recognized (though in a different\\ncontext) that such a demand is not practical for most people, and I\\nthink the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced that\\njudgement.  The practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gay\\nsex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality.  Maybe\\nhomosexuality isn\\'t God\\'s original ideal, but I can well imagine Paul\\npreferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian\\nrelationships than promiscuity.  As with work -- which Genesis\\nsuggests wasn\\'t part of God\\'s original ideal either -- I think such\\nrelationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God\\'s love\\nwith each other.\\n\\nThere\\'s an issue of Biblical interpretation underlying this\\ndiscussion.  The issue is that of \"cultural relativism\".  That is,\\nwhen Paul says that something is wrong, should this be taken as an\\neternal statement, or are things wrong because of specific situations\\nin the culture of the time?  Conservative Christians generally insist\\non taking prohibitions as absolute, since otherwise the Bible becomes\\nsubjective -- what is to stop us from considering everything in it as\\nrelative?\\n\\nWhen looking at this issue, it\\'s worth noting that no one completely\\nrejects the concept of cultural relativism.  There are a number of\\njudgements in the New Testament that even conservative Christians\\nconsider to be relative.  The following judgements are at least as\\nclear in the Bible as anything said on homosexuality:\\n\\n  - prohibition against charging interest (this occurs 18 times in\\n\\tthe OT -- it\\'s not in the NT, but I mention it here because\\n\\tuntil relatively recently the Church did consider it binding\\n\\ton Christians)\\n  - prohibition against swearing oaths\\n  - endorsement of slavery as an institution\\n  - judgement of tax collectors as sinner\\n\\nWe do not regard these items as binding.  In most cases, I believe the\\nargument is essentially one of cultural relativism.  Briefly:\\n\\n  - prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specific\\n\\tagrarian society that the Bible was trying to build,\\n\\tbut not to our market economy.\\n  - few people believe that American judicial oaths have the\\n\\tsame characteristics as the kind of oaths Jesus was\\n\\tconcerned about\\n  - most people believe that Paul was simply telling people\\n\\thow to live within slavery, but not endorsing it as\\n\\tan institution\\n  - for people believe that the IRS is morally equivalent to\\n\\tRoman tax farming\\n\\nThe point I\\'m trying to make is that before applying Biblical\\nprohibitions to the 20th Cent., we need to look at whether the 20th\\nCent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that their\\nrelationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul\\nwould have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of\\nargument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors.\\nUntil fairly recently Christians prohibited taking of interest, and\\nmany Christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed.  (Indeed,\\nslavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationship\\nbetween God and human beings -- Christians are often called servants\\nor slaves of God.)\\n\\nI am not trying to say that everything in the Bible is culturally\\nrelative.  Rather, I\\'m trying to say that *some* things are, and\\ntherefore it is not enough to say that because something appears in\\nthe Bible, that ends the discussion.  We need to look at whether the\\naction we\\'re talking about now has the same moral implications as the\\none that the Bible was talking about.  If Christians want to argue\\nthat there are reasons to think that the prohibitions against\\nhomosexuality are still binding, I\\'m willing to listen.  Those who\\nclaim that the question doesn\\'t need to be looked at are kidding\\nthemselves (unless they are part of the small minority who really obey\\nall the rules listed above).\\n\\nOne thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issue\\ncreates.  When you consider the weakness of the Biblical evidence --\\nsome laws in Leviticus, a passage in Rom whose subject matter is\\nreally idolatry rather than homosexuality, and a couple of lists whose\\nwords are ambiguous -- the amount of concern this is raising among\\nChristians seems rather out of proportion.  This should suggest to\\npeople that there are reasons other than simply Biblical involved.\\nThis is true on both sides -- clearly homosexual Christians are as\\nstrongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the Biblical arguments\\nas conservative Christians are to find Biblical arguments.  But I\\ncan\\'t help feeling that the Bible is being used by both sides as a way\\nof justifying attitudes which come from other sources.  This is a\\ndangerous situation for Christians.\\n\\nOn the other side of the issue, I would like to note some problems I\\nhave with the pro-homosexual position as it is commonly presented.\\nOne of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologically\\ndetermined.  I.e. \"God made me homosexual\", and I have no choice.  I\\nthink \"God made me homosexual\" is a fine view for people who already\\nbelieve on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable.  But I\\ndon\\'t see it as an argument for acceptability.\\n\\nMany people think that alcholism is largely biological, and drug\\naddiction may turn out to be as well.  That doesn\\'t mean it\\'s OK.\\nMost of us have particular things we tend to do wrong.  Some people\\nget angry easily.  Others tend to be arrogant.  Others tend to be\\nattraced to women who are married to someone else.  Homosexuality (if\\nwe view it as wrong) wouldn\\'t be different than any of these other\\nthings.  If we are going to follow God, we all end up at one time or\\nanother having to work to overcome bad habits and particular\\ntemptations that cause us problems.  None of us can sit back and say\\nthat because God made us the way we are we can just relax.  As Jesus\\nsaid, we all have to take up our cross daily.  This concept of dying\\nto self (which also appears throughout Paul\\'s letters) seems to\\nsuggest that there are going to be things about ourselves that we we\\nare called on not to accept.  Paul\\'s letters and the experience of\\nChristians throughout history show us that sin is ingrained in us, and\\nthe battle against it is lifelong and difficult.  The fact that\\nhomosexuality is difficult to fight doesn\\'t necessarily say it\\'s OK.\\nMaybe this isn\\'t the place where we have to die to self.  But I\\'d like\\nto make sure that those who think it isn\\'t are fighting the battle\\nsomewhere else, and not rejecting the concept that all Christians have\\nto fight against the deeply engrained habits of sin.\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

Bailey\\n\\n     D.S. Bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning\\nof arsenokoitai.  He takes the term in I Cor 6:9 as denoting males who actively\\nengage in homosexual acts, in contrast to malakoi (\"effeminate\"), those who\\nengage passively in such acts.*4   However, he insists that Paul knew nothing\\nof \"inversion as an inherited trait, or an inherent condition due to\\npsychological or glandular causes, and consequently regards all homosexual\\npractice as evidence of perversion\" (38).  Hence Bailey limits the term\\'s\\nreference in Paul\\'s works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the\\nterm as \"homosexuals.\"  Bailey wants to distinguish between \"the homosexual\\n*condition* (which is morally neutral) and homosexual *practices*\" [italics in\\nsource].  Paul is precise in his terminology and Moffatt\\'s translation\\n\"sodomites\" best represents Paul\\'s meaning in Bailey\\'s judgment (39).  Bailey\\nclearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers.\\n\\nJ. Boswell\\n\\n     The most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is\\nthat of John Boswell.*5    Whereas the usual translation*6  of this term gives\\nit either explicitly or implicitly an active sense, Boswell gives it a passive\\nsense.\\n\\n      In an extended discussion of the term (341-53), he cites \"linguistic\\nevidence and common sense\" to support his conclusion that the word means \"male\\nsexual agents, i.e. active male prostitutes.\"  His argument is that the arseno-\\npart of the word is adjectival, not the object of the koitai which refers to\\nbase sexual activity.  Hence the term, according to Boswell, designates a male\\nsexual person or male prostitute.  He acknowledges, however, that most\\ninterpret the composite term as active, meaning \"those who sleep with, make\\ntheir bed with, men.\"  Boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the\\nhistorical setting.  He argues that in some compounds, such as paidomathes\\n(\"child learner\"), the paido- is the subject of manthano, and in others, such\\nas paidoporos (\"through which a child passes\"), the paido- is neither subject\\nnor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance.  His point is\\nthat each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning.  More\\ndirectly, he maintains that compounds with the Attic form arreno- employ it\\nobjectively while those with the Hellenistic arseno- use it as an adjective\\n(343).  Yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno-.\\n\\n     Boswell next appeals to the Latin of the time, namely drauci or exoleti. \\nThese were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects.  The Greek\\narsenokoitai is the equivalent of the Latin drauci;  the corresponding passive\\nwould be parakoitai (\"one who lies beside\"), Boswell affirms.  He claims that\\narsenokoitai was the \"most explicit word available to Paul for a male\\nprostitute,\" since by Paul\\'s time the Attic words pornos (\"fornicator\") and\\nporneuon (\"one committing fornication\"), found also in the LXX, had been\\nadopted \"to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed\\nfornication.\"*7\\n\\n     In the absence of the term from pagan writers such as Herodotus, Plato,\\nAristotle, and Plutarch, and from the Jewish writers Philo and Josephus,\\nBoswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that\\narsenokoitai \"did not connote \\'homosexual\\' or even \\'sodomite\\' in the time of\\nPaul\" (346).*8   He also demonstrates its absence in Pseudo-Lucian, Sextus\\nEmpiricus, and Libanius.  He subsequently finds it lacking in \"all discussions\\nof homosexual relation\" (346)*9  among Christian sources in Greek, including\\nthe Didache, Tatian, Justin Martyr, Eusebius,*10    Clement of Alexandria,\\nGregory of Nyssa, and John Chrysostom.  Chrysostom is singled out for his\\nomission as \"final proof\" that the word could not mean homosexuality.*11 \\n\\n     Boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of I Cor and I Tim from\\ndiscussions of homosexuality among Latin church fathers (348).*12   Cited are\\nTertullian, Arnobius, Lactantius, and Augustine.  The last named uses\\n\"circumlocutions.\"  Other Latin writers include Ausonius, Cyprian, and Minucius\\nFelix.  The term is also lacking in state and in church legislation.  By the\\nsixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual\\nactivities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife\\n(353).\\n\\n     Having surveyed the sources, Boswell concludes, \\n\\n   There is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted\\n   homosexuality in the time of Paul or for centuries thereafter, and every\\nreason\\n   to suppose that, whatever they came to mean, they were not determinative of\\n   Christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts (353).\\n\\nIt is clear throughout that Boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male\\nprostitutes.  He even goes so far as to conclude that Paul would probably not\\ndisapprove of \"gay inclination,\"  \"gay relationships,\"  \"enduring love between\\npersons of the same gender,\" or \"same-sex eroticism\"  (112, 166-17).\\n\\n\\n________________________________________________________\\n4.  D.S. Bailey,  Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition. (London:\\n1975) 38.\\n5.  J.  Boswell, Christianity,  Social Tolerance and Homosexuality (Chicago:\\n1980).\\n6.  Several tranlation of I Tim 1:10 are:  KJV, \"them that defile themselves\\nwith mankind\";  ASV,  \"Abusers of themselves with men\";  NASB,  \"homosexuals\";\\nRSV, NKJV, NRSV, \"sodomites\";  NEB, NIV, \"perverts\"; GNB, \"sexual perverts\"; In\\nI COr 6:9 these occur:  KJV, \"abusers of themselves with mankind\"; ASV,\\n\"Abusers of themselves with men\";  NASB, RSV, \"homosexuals\"; NKJV, \"sodomites\";\\n NEB, \"homosexual persversion.\"  The RSV and NEB derive their translation from\\ntwo Greek words, malakoi and arsenokoitai which GBN has as \"homosexual\\nperverts.\"  NRSV has the two words as \"male prostitutes\" in the text, and\\n\"sodomites\" in the footnote.  The active idea predominates among the\\ncommentators as well;  it is the primary assumption.\\n7.  Boswell, Christianity 344.  Yet this was no a word \"available to Paul for a\\nmale prostitute,\" for it does not occur at all in any literature prior to Paul\\n(as a serach in the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae using IBYCUC confirms).

The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\\n   version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\\n   I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\\n   (for better or for worse).\\n\\n   I pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\\n   a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\n   the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\\n   a portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\n   station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\n   frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\\n   5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\n   I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\\n   card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\\n   imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\\n   keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\n   to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\\n   \"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\n   frames.\\n\\n   I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\\n   for the results I\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\n   Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\n   That\\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\n   test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\n   disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\\n   was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\\n   (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\n   I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\n   scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\n   size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\\n   observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\\n   action, not 1.5. I\\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\\'t think it\\'s\\n   entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\\n\\n   Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\n   The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n   \"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\n   from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\\'s normal synchronized playback).\\n   A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was\\n   very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\\n   ease. I can\\'t believe that QuickTime\\'s synchronization code would add this\\n   much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\\'s task\\n   switching.\\n\\n   A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\\'t see\\n   any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\\n   stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\\n\\n   I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\\n   key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\\n   improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\\n   even more...\\n\\n   Lawrence D\\'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889\\n   Computer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066\\n   University of Waikato            electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz\\n   Hamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47\\' 26\" S, 175^ 19\\' 7\" E, GMT+12:00\\n\\n\\nI\\'m afraid I missed the start of this thread, but there are three factors that\\ncan significantly affect QuickTime\\'s playback speed that you may want to take\\ninto account:\\n\\n(1) playback bit depth (things are fastest when you play a\\nmovie back at the bit depth it was compressed for, this is usually 8 or 16\\nbit, but other depths are (of course) possible).\\n\\n(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for \"double size\" scaling, other scaling\\nfactors hit peformance much harder).\\n\\n(3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices\\nto advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I\\'m not sure about Premiere).\\n\\nAny combination of those can radically alter playback performance.

I see two possible theories.  One, the L. acidophilus, which is a \\nfacultatively anaerobic bacterium, could make it through the gut and \\ncolonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida.  This would not explain \\nthe reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion \\nwas stopped though.  The other is that the additional bacteria in the \\nintestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida \\nlooses it\\'s major food source.\\n\\nGetting Lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract(where it is \\nnormally found) would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal \\nyeast blooms though.  An acetic acid, Lactobacillus acidophilus douche has \\nbeen used to get this effect but I\\'ve not seen any such treatment reported in \\nthe medical literature.  This would be an example of physicians conducting \\ntheir own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their \\npatients.  When this is done in private practice, the results are rarely, if \\never published.  It was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age \\nemerged with clinical trials.  It really raises a big question.  Does the \\nmedical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to \\nhelp patients or does it look the other way.\\n\\nThis particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous \\ntherapy is involved(even the anti-fungals are not all that dangerous).  But \\nthere are some areas(like EDTA chelation therapy), where the fire is pretty \\nhot and somebody could get burned.  It\\'s really tough.  Do I follow only \\nwell established protocols and then give up if they don\\'t work that well or \\ndo it try something that looks like it will work but hasn\\'t been proven to \\nwork yet?\\n\\nMy stand is to consider other treatment possibilities, especially if they \\ninvolve little or no risk to the patient.

Anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns\\nthis. At some centers pre-op liver transplant patients receive bowel\\ndecontamination directed at retaining \"good\" anaerobic flora in an attempt\\nto prevent fungal colonization in this soon-to-be high risk group.  I also\\nuse lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea (that may\\nbe in part due to alterations in gut flora).  However, it is NOT part of\\nmy routine practice to \"reinnoculate\" patients with \"good\" bacteria after\\nantibiotics.  I have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating\\nfungal infections in at risk patients.  Whether or not it is a \"logical\\nextension\" from the available observations I\\'ll leave to those of you who\\nbase strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of\\nclinical trials. \\n  One place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly\\nrecalcitrant cases of C. difficile colitis (NOT a fungal infection). There\\nare case reports of using stool (ie someone elses) enemas to repopulate\\nthe patients flora.  Don\\'t try this at home. \\n\\n>not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.  Since candida \\n>colonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area, GI symptoms should be more common \\n>than vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use.\\n\\n  Except that it isn\\'t. At least symptomatically apparent disease.\\n\\n>Medicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way.  There \\n>has always been the use of conventional wisdom.  A very good example is \\n>kidney stones.

The three active-treatment regimens\\n     and the all-placebo regimen\\n     significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms (P less than\\n     0.001), but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms\\n     significantly more than placebo. [ . . . ]\\n     CONCLUSIONS. In women with presumed candidiasis\\n     hypersensitivity syndrome, nystatin does not reduce systemic or\\n     psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo. Consequently,\\n     the empirical recommendation of long-term nystatin therapy for such\\n     women appears to be unwarranted.\\n\\n  Does this trial address every issue raised here, no.

Medical doctors have a very specific and specialized \"jargon\",\\nnecessary for precise communication within their field (which I\\'m fully\\ncognizant of since I, too, speak \"jargonese\" when with my peers).  For the\\nsituation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can\\nhave a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the\\nworld at large, causing significant miscommunication.  One example word,\\nand very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of \"systemic\".\\nIt is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much\\nmore so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  There is also the observation of\\nthis newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially\\nequal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan\\nthe flames.  This is probably the first time that practicing doctors get\\nreally \"beat up\" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they\\notherwise don\\'t see much of in their practice except for the occasional\\n\"difficult\" patient.\\n\\nPoint 2:\\n\\nI understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not\\nprescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments\\nhave been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed\\nclinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are\\npart of an approved and funded clinical trial.  To these doctors, to do any\\ndifferently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  And it\\nfollows that any therapy not on the \"accepted\" list is therefore a non-\\ntherapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or\\ntheory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation\\nof what is currently known.  Anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from\\na treatment point-of-view.\\n\\nAnd by and large, as a scientist myself, I am glad that medical practice/\\nscience takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  However, as\\nalso being a human being (last I checked), and having been one of those people\\nthat has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where\\n\"standard\" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and\\nwonder if holding such an extreme and rigid \"scientific\" viewpoint is in\\nitself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  After all, the underlying\\nintent of the \"scientific\" approach to medicine is to protect the health of\\nthe patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the\\npatient should come first when considering treatment.\\n\\nWhat we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both\\nthe \"scientific\" and the \"humanitarian\" viewpoints.  In an earlier post I\\noutlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  The gist of it was to give any\\nphysician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe\\nalternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence)\\nfor patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted\\n(and not until then).  The patient would be fully informed that such\\ntherapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that\\nthere are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived\\nfrom them.\\n\\nThis approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  It also satisfies\\nthe humanitarian needs of the patient.  And the reality is that many patients\\nwho have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted\\nmedicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the\\ndoctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing\\ntheir license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical\\ntraining.  This approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control\\nmore within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned\\ncould help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most\\nproductive way.  Everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - I\\'m\\nsure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented\\nmore as a strawman to stimulate discussion.\\n\\nHopefully what I write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to\\nwhy I am \"open\" to alternative therapies, as well as why I have real\\ndifficulty (read \"apparent hostility\") with the \"coldness\" of the 99.9% pure\\n\"scientific\" approach to medicine.

That\\'s unavoidable behavior.\\n\\nIt is nonsense to say that I believe another person\\'s god to be greater than\\nmy God.  Were his or her god greater, wouldn\\'t I be obligated to change so\\nthat their god would become my God?  We are naturally obligated to worship\\nthat God which we deem to be the greatest.  Why should we feel obligated to\\nworship a second best god for the sake of feeling humble?\\n\\nArrogance is not necessarily thinking onesself to be better looking or more\\nintelligent or stronger or having more resources than another person.  No\\ndoubt many will have to chew on this one awhile.  Were passive observation\\nof one\\'s superior points arrogance, then God would be most arrogant of all.\\n\\nHumility does not rest in slandering or belittling God\\'s work of creation in\\nour lives.  People often go around trying to be humble saying to one another,\\n\"I\\'m not very smart.  I\\'m poor.  I\\'m not good looking.  I\\'m just a worm in\\nthe ground.  I\\'m such a weak person and although I don\\'t want to sin, I\\nreally cannot help it.\"  Were this person truely humble, he would take a\\ndifferent approach.  \"God, thank you for making me the way you did.  I know\\nthat you never do anything second best.  Yet with all that you have given me,\\nI have been so unthankful.  You\\'ve given me power to resist the devil.

Lord,\\nplease forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that I can bring\\nglory to Your Name instead of insult.  Lord I\\'m so sorry for my wrongs.  Please\\nhelp me to change.\"\\n\\n: \\n: I think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because\\n: they don\\'t want to be wrong.  If I find someone arrogant, I typically\\n: don\\'t have anything to do with them.\\n\\nFor me, I\\'ve often found it hard to tell the difference.  Often times, the\\nmost humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the most\\nproud \"worm in the ground\" false humility type person has been found to be\\nmost comfortable company.\\n\\nWhen I\\'m wrong and arrogant about my wrongness, I certainly don\\'t feel like\\nbeing confronted by my wrongness.  Were someone to confront me verbally with\\nmy wrongness, I\\'d be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for\\nall their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to me.\\nAt the root, my desire would be to make them shut up so that I can go about\\nliving my life arrogantly as I wish.  However, were someone to confront me\\nsilently by their example, earn my respect, and perhaps mention it to me in\\nhumility in private, I\\'d feel broken down and challenged to seek God for help\\nin changing from the error of my ways.\\n\\nThe hard part is getting to the point to where I can be humble before anyone\\nregardless of their humility or pride--regardless of their hypocricy or\\nsincerity--regardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or not.\\nIt isn\\'t easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity\\nto improve in one\\'s ability to serve God.  It\\'s easier to cast aside any hope\\nof reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering God\\'s creation\\nin our lives instead.\\n\\n: But we should examine ourselves [I hope I typed this back in right]\\n: and why we react to certain situations with such emotions.  For instance,\\n: many of us feel \"justified\" to be insulted by an arrogant person.  As if\\n: we needed a reason to feel insulted.  But after being insulted over and\\n: over again by the words of others, you\\'d think we\\'d either toughen up\\n: or decide not to be insulted, or ignore the insult.  Just because you\\n: can justify feelings of anger or insult or outrage, that doesn\\'t make that\\n: reaction the appropriate one.  It is in this light of self-examination\\n: that we can change our emotional reactions.\\n: \\n\\nSometimes it helps when we can understand and feel the difference between\\nwhat is a true statement of our character and what is a false and slanderous\\nstatement of our character.  The devil is the accuser of the bretheren.  He\\nwould love us to feel hopelessly guilty where we are innocent and feel arrogant\\nand self-righteous where we are indeed wrong.

I say those who are not saved are not\\nsaved on account of their own sins.  It is not because God did not give\\nthem sufficient grace, for He does do so, in His desire that all men\\nmight be saved.  However, as only some are saved - and those who are\\nsaved are saved by the grace of God, \"not by works, lest any man should\\nboast\" - the others are damned because of their obstinacy in refusing to\\nheed the call of God.  They are damned by their own free will and\\nchosing, a choice forseen by God in His causing them to be not\\npredestined, but reprobated instead.\\n\\n>so God uses grace like margarine: he only spreads it where it\\'s needed\\n>and not where it isn\\'t?  and so there are the saved and the not-saved,\\n>and nothing in between.  hmmmm.\\n\\nCertainly God does not distribute grace evenly.  If He did, no one could\\nhave their heart hardened (or rather, harden their heart, thus causing\\nGod to withdraw His grace).  But, you are correct - the world is divided\\ninto those who God knows to be saved, and those God knows to be on the\\nroad to perdition.  THe key is that God knows it and we do not.  Thus,\\nno one can boast in complete assurance that they are one of the elect\\nand predestined.

Unless you do penance here on earth, you will have to do it\\nin Purgatory, as Paul pointed out (1 Corinthians 3.15).  Those with\\npoorer works, though still done with good intentions, will only be saved\\nthrough fire (the damned will of course go into fire immeadiately, for\\nwhatever good they did was not for God but for self (dead works)).  Of\\ncourse, the Church gives indulgences, has Confession, and Annointing of\\nthe Sick to remove sin and the the vestiges of sin, so there is really\\nlittle excuse for ending up in Purgatory - it is a last hope for the\\nsomewhat lazy and careless as I said above in referring to Paul.\\n\\nAnd no comments were taken as flames.

The question, really, has to do with the\\nstatus of the Greek Septuagint versus Hebrew scripture.  And the issue\\npredates the Reformation by quite a bit -- Jerome was negative about the\\n\"deuteroncanonicals\" and in fact, even though he transalted them, he put\\nthem after the Hebrew canon (reordered from the Greek ordering to the\\nHebrew one.)  His translations of them were quick-and-dirty, also (he\\nreports having done one of them in one day, and another overnight, just\\ndictating his translation to an amanuensis.\\n\\nThat is to say, it is the Vulgate, and all of its massive importance in\\nWestern Christianity, along with the veneration of Jerome, which took the\\nfirst steps in \"reducing\" these books from the status they had (and have)\\namong the Greeks.\\n\\nFurthermore, it is inaccurate to say that the Reformers \"threw out\" these\\nbooks.  Basically, they just placed them in a secondary status (as Jerome\\nhad already done), but with the additional warning that doctrine should\\nnot be based on citations from these ALONE.\\n\\nI think that the emphasis on the Hebrew originals is sound, though it\\nseems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation as\\npart of a collection whose principles of selection (in Hebrew or Greek)\\nare confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident.  It also seems\\nto play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow\\n\"more inspired\" -- as if magical, and conveying a message untranslatable\\n-- than a translation, as if we could not hear God\\'s word to the Jews in\\nGreek (or German, or English, ...).  This tendency seems to have got a\\nbig boost in _sola scriptura_ Protestantism, even to the point of current\\n\"inerrancy\" bizarreness, despite the more basic, underlying tendency of\\nthe Reformers to see that the texts SHOULD and COULD be translated.  If\\nwe can profit from an English rendering of Hebrew and Greek, there is\\nsurely little reason to keep Sirach, at least, out of our Bibles (and of\\ncourse, Anglicans don\\'t do so :-)).  For texts originally in Greek, it\\nwould seem more to be anti-Greek prejudice (notably, by the time the\\nHebrew canon is fully attested, including anti-Christian prejudice which\\nled to the Jewish abandonment of the Septuagint) which is operative.\\n\\nBTW: readers may enjoy some lectures of Bruce Metzger on the issues of\\ntranslation of the Bible (including some of what I said about Jerome,\\nabove) in the current numbers of the journal _Bibliotheca Sacra_; two\\nof four have been published so far.\\n-- \\nMichael L.

If it\\nchanges anything. \\n\\nYou can live on the diet but you need to up your calories. Where before you\\nhad a pat of butter now you need a medium apple (probably microwave\\ncooked).  Smaller meals but more of them. Not terrific amounts of meat, it\\'s\\nhard to digest anyway. \\n\\nFor comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal \"last\" longer eat pasta or\\nrice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn. Maybe\\nsmaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area. Is the\\nbaby still coming up. Is it starting to push or rub under your ribs? How\\ntight are your clothes. You shouldn\\'t be wearing any clothing that compresses \\nyour middle. Be sure not to \"suck in\" your stomach when sitting, again it\\nwill put pressure on the digestive tract. \\n\\nTry laying on your sides, back,\\nand stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive.\\nEasier on your legs (circulation) as well. You might try letting the baby\\n\"turn\" or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months.\\nWhen you are shortwaisted it\\'s easy for that baby to end up right under the\\ndiaphram, especially if you have tight abdominal muscles. If I had my\\nsecond one to do over again I think I\\'d have tried to loosen up since he\\ndidn\\'t turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous.\\n\\n\\nMaybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe\\nshe just nags all her patients this way. Especially if she\\'s young. \\nBut this gallbladder/whatever problem that might be coming up is something\\nto be avoided if possible. \\n\\nNausea, etc. can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy.

Where Luke (1:17) reports\\nthe angel Gabriel prophesying that John will go before Christ \"in the \\npower and spirit of Elias\", In Matthew 11: 14, Jesus himself says of John,\\n   \\n   \"And if you care to accept it, he himself is Elijah, who\\n    was to come\".\\n\\nIt is interesting that Jesus prepended the words, \"If you care to accept\\nit\", as if to say that the implications of this truth, namely of rein-\\ncarnation, I will not force on you, but for those who can accept it, here it\\nis.  A Jewish poster to other newsgroups on Jewish esotericism and other\\ntopics has outlined the esoteric, cabbalistic Jewish teaching of of\\nreincarnation and Karma, a teaching that is little known among Jews\\ntoday, but which is apparently widespread enough in Israel that Hannah\\nHurnard (\"Hinds Feet on High Places\") was told about it by a Rabbi\\nshe was trying to convert back in the 1940s as a missionary in Palestine.\\nThus there may well have been a small number of Jews who knew about this,\\nwhereas the large number of people did not.  The statement of Jesus about \\nJohn, the greatest human personality in the New Testament, is guarded\\nbut nevertheless quite direct.  Again, the subject of reincarnation, one\\nway or another, is not a subject of the New Testament, nor is the fate in general\\nof the human being between death and the last judgement.  But there are \\noccasional indications that point to it.\\n\\nAs for the \"popular belief\" that Elijah would come again, it was more than \\na popular belief, as Jesus confirms it in more than one place, and he never \\ncorrected those who were expecting Elijah --  for example, those who thought \\nthat Jesus himself be he.\\n\\nGerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

Many young adults come there to search for meaning in \\ntheir life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a \\nsharing with others. This newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a \\nmonthly \"Johannine Hour\" which will be posted at the beginning of each \\nmonth. A \"Johannine hour\" involves a short commentary on a given Bible \\npassage, followed by some questions for reflection.  Any thoughts that \\nmay arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be \\nposted here. We are not interested in theological debate, and even less \\nin polemics. No expertise is required! The idea is to help one another \\nto deepen our understanding of Scripture as it is related to our own \\nlife-journey.\\n\\nThe idea of \"Johannine hours\" was born in Taize as a simple response\\nto all those who were trying to assimilate the Bible\\'s message in the\\nmidst of their daily life. Because of work or studies, it is often\\nimpossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection, but\\neveryone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church, sit\\nquietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods. There, in silence,\\nwe can meditate on a passage of Scripture to listen to the voice of\\nChrist.\\n\\nDuring the time of silence, it is important to concentrate on what we \\nunderstand and not waste time worrying if, in some Biblical expressions, \\nwe find it difficult to hear the voice of Christ. The idea is to \\ncommunicate to others what we have understood of Christ, not burdening \\nthem with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought \\nus joy, what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply.\\n\\nPerhaps those who read and think about the \"Johannine Hours\" in this\\nnewsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others.\\n\\nThe important thing is the complementarity between two aspects, the\\npersonal aspect of silent, personal reflection and the communal aspect\\nof sharing, which through Usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network.\\n\\nBACKGROUND OF THE TAIZE COMMUNITY:\\n=================================\\n\\nThe following provides some background information on the life and\\nvocation of the Taize (pronounced te-zay) community.\\n\\n\"A PARABLE OF COMMUNION\": August 1940, with Europe in the grip of\\nWorld War II, Brother Roger, aged 25, set up home in the almost\\nabandoned village of Taize, in Eastern France. His dream: to bring\\ntogether a monastic community which would live out \"a parable of\\ncommunity\", a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress of\\nthe time. Centering his life on prayer, he used his house to conceal\\nrefugees, especially Jews fleeing from the Nazi occupation.\\n\\nAN INTERNATIONAL AND ECUMENICAL COMMUNITY: Taize\\'s founder spent the\\nfirst two years alone. Others joined him later and at Easter 1949,\\nseven brothers committed themselves together to common life and\\ncelibacy. Year by year, still others have entered the community, each\\none making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation.\\nToday, there are 90 brothers, Catholics and from various Protestant\\nbackgrounds, from over twenty different countries. Some of them are\\nliving in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in Asia, Africa, North\\nand South America. The brothers accept no donations or gifts for\\nthemselves, not even family inheritances, and the community holds no\\ncapital. The brothers earn their living and share with others\\nentirely through their own work. In 1966, Sisters of Saint Andrew, an\\ninternational Catholic community founded 750 years ago, came to live\\nin the neighbouring village, to share the responsibility of welcoming\\npeople in Taize.\\n\\nTAIZE AND THE YOUNG; THE INTERCONTINENTAL MEETINGS: Young adults, and\\nless young, have been coming to Taize in ever greater numbers since\\n1957. Hundreds of thousands of people from Europe and far beyond have\\nthus been brought together in a common search. Intercontinental\\nmeetings take place each week, Sunday to Sunday, throughout the year\\nand they include youth from between 35 and 60 countries during any\\none week. The meetings give each person the opportunity to explore\\nthe roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the inner\\nlife and human solidarity. The meetings in summer can have up to\\n6,000 participants a week. Three times every day, the brothers and\\neverybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the Church\\nof Reconciliation, built in 1962 when the village church became too\\nsmall.\\n\\n\"A PILGRIMAGE OF TRUST ON EARTH\" The community has never wanted to\\ncreate a \"movement\" around itself. Instead, people are called to\\ncommit themselves in their church at home, in their neighbourhood,\\ntheir city or village. To support them in this, Taize has created\\nwhat it calls \"a pilgrimage of trust on earth\". At the end of each\\nyear, the pilgrimage has a \"European meeting\" which brings together\\ntens of thousands of young adults from every part of Europe for\\nseveral days in a major city. There have also been meetings in Asia\\nand in the United States. Every year, Brother Roger writes an open\\nletter to the young. Usually completed during a stay in one of the\\npoor regions of the world, these are translated into thirty languages\\nand provide themes for reflexion for the following year.\\n\\nNOTE:  Discussion on the creation of this newsgroup will take place in \\n       news.groups.\\n\\nFor any further information contact: Brother.Roy@almac.co.uk\\n\\n               brother.roy@almac.co.uk\\n-- \\n . 1st 1.10b #332 .

How do you (Mormons) reconcile\\n>the idea of eternal marriage with Christ\\'s statement that in the ressurection\\n>people will neither marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)?\\n\\nWell, here is something I wrote some time ago in response to a\\nsimilar question.  I hope it helps:\\n\\n[Begin repeat of previous post]\\n\\nAs for the scripture mentioned I agree that it does seem to be a \\nproblem, not only for eternal marriage but marriage in general.  \\nLuke\\'s version has Jesus saying that the children of this world \\nmarry and are given in marriage but not those who will attain\\nthe kingdom of heaven.  It almost sounds like marriage disqualifies\\none for salvation.  (Matthew and Mark both omit this statement.)   I\\nthink the accounts are not as clear as they might be.  Let\\'s have a\\nlook at the incident and see if we can come up with some reasonable\\nideas of what it means.  The scriptures involved are Mat 22:23-30,\\nMark 12:18-25, and Luke 20:27-36.\\n\\nWhat happened was that the Sadducees, who did not believe in the\\nresurrection, thought they could trap Jesus.  They made reference to\\nthe \"Leverite\" marriage which required the brother of a man who died\\nwithout children to take the widow to wife and raise up children.  \\nThe children would be considered children of the deceased, just as\\nthough the woman\\'s first husband had fathered them.  It seems\\nobvious from this that the woman was still considered in a way to be\\nthe wife of her first husband.  However, the Sadducees concocted a\\nscene in which 6 brothers of the deceased each in his turn failed to\\nfather children by the widow.  They seem to imply that the Leverite\\nmarriage was equal to the first for they ask, \"Whose wife shall she\\nbe in the resurrection?\"  At this point it seems obvious that if she\\nis anybody\\'s wife, it is the first husband.  After all, had she\\nborne children they would have been credited to him regardless of\\nwhich brother was the biological father.  It is possible Jesus was\\nrefering to this when he says, \"Ye do err, not knowing the\\nscriptures or the power of God.\" (Mat 22:29, compare Mark 12:24,\\nphrase not in Luke\\'s account).\\n\\nAnyway, the Sadducees ask, \"Whose wife will she be in the\\nresurrection, seeing that all 7 had her?\"  Jesus answer is that,\\n\"In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in\\nmarriage...\" (Mat 22:30) \"When they rise from the dead they neither\\nmarry...\" (Mark 12:25)  \"They which are accounted worthy to obtain\\nthat world neither marry...\" (Luke 20:35)  All 3 accounts go on to\\nsay, \"but are as the angels in heaven\" or the equivalent.  I find\\nthis last not very helpful since the Bible does not define angels\\nnor give any idea what their life is like.  (Some ministers claim\\nthat they are sexless, different that humans etc. but I can find no\\nBiblical support for this.)\\n\\nI think what Jesus is saying here (and it is clearest in Matthew\\'s\\nand Mark\\'s accounts) is that marriages will not be performed in the\\nresurrection.  This goes along with our belief that if a person is\\nto marry at all it must be done on this earth.  However, we do\\nbelieve that a marriage performed by the authority of God can be\\nbinding in eternity.  In fact, the first marriage appears to have\\nbeen performed by God himself before death entered the world (in the\\nGarden of Eden).  What therefore God hath joined together, let not\\nman put asunder. (Mat 19:6)  Jesus also told Peter and the other\\napostles that whatsoever they should bind on earth should be bound\\nin heaven (Mat 16:19, 18:18).  I believe that this also refers to\\nmarriages performed by the proper authority.\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

Noring and the\\nfellow from Oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one set\\nof anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences ---\\nnamely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals,\\nmany of them appear to get better.  \\n\\nSo, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example,\\ncontrolled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don\\'t do any\\nbetter than sugar water --- then let\\'s hear it.  If you don\\'t, then what we\\nhave is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject\\ndisbelief on the other.  In which case, please, there is no point in yelling\\nback and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any\\nconvincing evidence either positive or negative.  \\n\\nAnd I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of\\npeople who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything\\nin sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to do\\ncontrolled studies.  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently\\nsincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals working\\non themselves and other people in certain specific cases.  There are also\\nquacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase, in spite of the fact that it\\'s\\ncompletely broken down in the guts, but this doesn\\'t change the genuine\\nscientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting\\noxidative damage.

If there\\'s some\\nother reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could be\\ntrue, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net people\\nhave been talking about.\\n\\nBut again, there is no point in arguing about it.  There is anecdotal\\nevidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also some\\ncandida quacks out there, I hope everyone can agree on all of that.  Thus,\\nit appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can\\nmarshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough\\nmanner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blind\\nstudy of antifungals (or else, forget convincing anybody else to carry out\\nthe test, just carry it out themselves!) --- and also, whether they can\\nadequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study\\nshould be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis.\\n\\nKen\\n-- \\n\\n' ------------> sci.med\n",

I\\'m going to include some of the material from Weinsier and \\nMorgan\\'s new Nutrition textbook(which was not in my original material) to \\npoint out that what I\\'m going to say has some support in the medical \\ncommunity.\\n\\nDiet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very, very long \\ntime.  Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and I\\'ve \\nalready covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection.\\nNow I\\'m going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in \\nthe U.S. as far as infection is concerned(vitamin A).\\n\\nWhen vitamin A was originally discovered, it was commonly referred to as \\nthe anti-infection vitamin.  Many people(Linus Pauling being one) have \\ndecided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C\\n(which I\\'ve already covered).  Big mistake(in my opinion).  Vitamin A is \\nalso getting a reputation as an anti-cancer vitamin(with good reason).\\nThe NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if \\nvitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well.  It\\'s role in \\nboth cancer and infection is almost identical(but not quite).\\n\\nVitamin A comes in two completely different forms(retinol and \\nbeta-carotene).  Retinol is the animal form and it\\'s toxic, beta-carotene \\nis the plant form and it\\'s completely nontoxic.  Both retinol and beta-\\ncarotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present\\n(60-80%).  The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other \\ntissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein(RBP).  A normal human \\nadult liver should have 500,000IU to 1,000,000IU of retinol stored.  We \\nare born with 10,000IU in our liver.  U.S. autopsy has shown that about \\n30% of Americans die with the same(or less) amount of vitamin A as they \\nwere born with.  If you don\\'t believe that nutritional reserves(like that \\nof retinol in the liver) are important, then this low vitamin A reserve is \\nnot going to affect you.  But if you believe(like I do) that the nutrient \\nreserves are important, then there is a problem with vitamin A in the U.S.\\n\\nThe U.S. RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is 1,000 RE or 5,000IU of \\nvitamin A.  For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4,000IU of vitamin A.  Diet \\nsurveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A\\n(either retinol or Beta-carotene) from their diet.  But the NRC(National \\nResearch Council) was going to release a new RDA table in 1985 that had the \\nRDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raised(C to 90mg per day and A to \\n7,500IU per day for adult males).  That report and it\\'s recommendations was \\nkilled.  Why? Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main \\nreason.  RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease, not to keep nutrient \\nreserves full.  Many scientist in the U.S. feel that the time has come to \\nmove away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move \\ntowards the promotion of optimum health concept, especially since we have \\nsome very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely \\nimportant during periods of stress.  The nutritonal concervatives won that \\nbattle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the \\n1989 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the \\ndietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the \\n1940\\'s(get enough to prevent clinical pathology, but not enough to fill \\nthe reserves).\\n\\nWe know from autopsy that only about 10% of Americans have a liver with a \\nnormal vitamin A reserve(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU).  I preach nutrient \\nreserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients.\\nBut for vitamin A, only a liver biopsy(or autopsy data) will tell you how \\nmuch somebody has stored.  We can tell very easily if someone has \\noverfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinol \\nlevel(levels above 450ug/dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your \\nliver with vitamin A and it\\'s time to stop taking retinol).  The normal \\nrange of serum retinol will be 20-100ug/dl.  Hypervitaminosis A is \\ndiagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2,000ug/dl or higher(Interpretation \\nof Diagnostic Test, Wallach, M.D., a Little Brown Series book).  This level \\nof vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to \\nvitamin A toxicity.  Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservative \\napproach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach, as you will see later in \\nthis post.  Between 450ug/dl and 2,000ug/dl you should have plenty \\nof warning that it\\'s time to eliminate the retinol from your diet(headache, \\nredness of the skin, hair loss, joint pain).\\n\\nI tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that they \\nhad better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear \\nsigns that the liver is full.  You will never really know if the patient \\nneeds the vitamin A(because you can not measure the pool in liver) but you \\nwill always know when it\\'s time to stop(just like in those vitamin A for \\nPMS studies).\\n\\nBeta-carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will \\nnever have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta-carotene to \\nretinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down(stops in the \\nliver and slows down in the gut) when your liver is full of retinol.  But \\ntaking Beta-carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to \\nfill the liver up(I\\'ve seen estimates of 20-30 years) if you are in the 30% \\nthat only has as much as you were born with in your liver(10,000IU).  One \\nother problem with beta-carotene, if you have a zinc deficit, you will not \\nconvert as much beta-carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the \\nenxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc.  In addition, the release of \\nretinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will \\ncause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin A.\\n\\nNow what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection?  The body \\nuses vitamin A(retinol) for many different things.  Vision(the first to be \\nnailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology) uses the aldehyde\\n(retinal) and alcohol(retinol) form of vitamin A.  Reproduction uses the \\nretinol form  and some retinal.  Infection and cancer protection uses \\nretinoic acid.  How do you convert retinol(which your white blood cells \\nand the mucosal cells get from blood) to retinoic acid?  You use enzymes, \\none of which requires vitamin C(this is why Pauling has tried to pull the \\ntitle of anti-infection vitamin away from vitamin A).  Vitamin C does play \\na role in infection(interferon production for example) but it\\'s biggest role \\nis the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid.  If you increase your intake \\nof vitamin C, you will increase your formation of retinoic acid.  But \\nretinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol(as retinal can) and once \\nit\\'s formed, it\\'s used and then lost to the body.  This is why the 1985 NRC \\ngroup wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDA\\'s.\\n\\nMost people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they are \\nhelping themselves.  If they don\\'t have much vitamin A in their liver and \\nthey are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A, they actually do \\nthemselves more harm than good.\\n\\nRetinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation.\\nIn the mucus membrane, it is the main factor in promoting good mucus \\nproduction and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from \\nentering the blood system.  The mucus membrane is referred to as the \"first \\nline\" defense against infection.  For cancer, retinoic acid has been shown \\nto act as a cell brake(it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which \\nstimulate cells to divide).  Cancer has two distinct steps, DNA alteration \\nand cell promotion.  For cells that normally divide all the time, promoters \\nare not that important.  But for lung and breast tissue which does not \\nnormally divide, promoters are real important in the malignant process.\\nThis is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trials \\nin progress using retinol and/or beta-carotene.\\n\\nChronic infection(irritation) of the mucus membranes is a signal that \\nvitamin A may not be adequate.  I tell my students that any patient who \\nwalks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be \\nworked up for vitamin A(along with the other factors that medicine already \\nhas on it\\'s list of causes for chronic infection).  I drive this home in my \\ncourse at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa, when I teach at the allopathic \\nmedical school in Tulsa(OU\\'s branch campus) and when I give CME lectures.\\n\\nDark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since night \\nvision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50,000IU of retinol.  The \\nserum level of retinol can also be used, but it does not drop until liver \\nreserves drop below 10,000 to 20,000IU.  Asking a patient if they have \\ntrouble seeing at night is a good initial screen(if cataracts are ruled \\nout).  In one study done on U.S. Spanish-Americans where serum retinol levels \\nwere measured, 25% of the sample population had a serum retinol level below \\n20ug/dl.\\n\\nAs more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of \\nthe U.S. that have had a history of high infection rates, we will probably \\nsee a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low \\nserum retinol levels.\\n\\nWhat do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A?  Here are excerpts\\nfrom their book:\\n\\nVitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol, it is necessay for \\ngrowth and differentation of epithelial tissue, and is required for \\nreproduction, embryonic development, and bone growth.  Protein-calorie \\nmalnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption, transport, and \\nmetabolism of vitamin A.  Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid, \\nwhich has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not \\nin reproduction or vision.  The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin A \\nstatus is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum.  The normal \\nrange for vitamin A content for a child is 20 to 90ug/dl.  Lower values are \\nindicators of deficiency or depleted body stores.  Serum levels greater \\nthan 100ug/dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A.  Dark adaptation \\ntests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to \\nperform on young children.  Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to \\nvitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state.  The \\nbronchorespiratory tract, skin, genitourinary system, gastrointestinal \\ntract and sweat glands are adversely affected.  A daily intake of more than \\n7.5mg(about 37,000IU) of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts \\nover 20mg(100,000IU) can result in a dry and itching skin, desquamation, \\nerythematous dermatitis, hair loss, joint pain, chapped lips, hyperostois\\n(bony depositis), headaches, anorexia, edema and fatigue.  \\n\\nThey recommend 30mg of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin A \\ndeficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults.  Their toxic serum retinol \\nlevel is very conservative.  I recommend that my students try 25,000IU in \\nadults that are having problems with chronic infection.  They have to rule \\nout a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc run(or if their clinical \\nlab can\\'t run it, I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest, give \\nthem the zinc along with the vitamin A.  At 25,000IU per day, toxicity \\nshould not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the \\npatient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol.\\n\\nBoth Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin A.\\nRecall that the PMS papers were using 100,000IU to 200,000IU of vitamin A.\\nI don\\'t suggest that my students use these high doses.  If you wanted to \\nfill the liver up fast(as part of a clinical trial) and were monitoring the \\nserum retinol level, then you would be okay.  But my knowledge of the \\nvitamin A literature suggests to me that 25,000IU for patients with a \\ndemonstrated vitamin A deficit(dark adapatation test or serum retinol) will \\nprovide a good and steady improvement(as long as zinc and vitamin C status \\nare good) without having to worry about toxicity.  If they want to get more \\nagressive, fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol.  But \\nvitamin A(retinol) should never be given in high dose to women who could \\nbecome pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the human \\nfetus.  The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is \\n18,000IU of retinol per day.  Beta-carotene will never have this effect on \\nthe human fetus.\\n\\nCould just taking Beta-carotene instead of retinol supplements help?  Yes \\nbut the effect will take a long time to develop.  My advise is to use \\nretinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep it \\nfull.  Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to \\nprescription by doctors.  But when we have the M.D.\\'s in this newsgroup \\njumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin A \\nsupplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and GI distress, I \\nthink that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin A in the OTC market \\nbut require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general \\npublic about the dangers of vitamin A supplementation.\\n\\nMarty B.\\n\\n' ------------> sci.med\n",

Housing in residence halls (each of which has\\nits own Blessed Sacrament chapel), if desired, is $30/person for double\\noccupancy for two nights ($30 total). Reservations can also be made for\\nyou at the very nearby Holiday Inn.  I think it was $47 a night there\\nfor my single room.  Meals are available at the cafeteria (Friday dinner\\nthrough Sunday lunch) for $38 or $32, with or without breakfast,\\nrespectively.\\n\\n   Franciscan University of Steubenville is located in eastern Ohio on\\nUS Route 22, 1/2 mile west of the Ohio River and Ohio Route 7.  Greater\\nPittsburgh International Airport is less than one hour (35 miles) from\\ncampus.\\n\\n   Feel free to e-mail me if you have any question I can answer.\\n\\n   Here is the agenda, as typed in by a friend of mine:\\n\\nFriday afternoon special:\\n\\nReflections on C.S. Lewis, a preliminary session with Walter Hooper.\\nWalter Hooper is one of the foremost international experts on the\\nwritings of C.S. Lewis.  In 1963, he served as secretary to C.S. Lewis,\\nand he has since edited 18 of Lewis\\' literary works for publication.\\nWalter was ordained a priest in the Church of England in 1965, serving\\nin Oxford, England, until he entered the Catholic Church in 1988.\\n\\n----------------\\nFriday evening, opening session:\\nIn Search of the Truth: Finding the Fullness of Faith\\nBishop Fabian Bruskewitz.\\n\\nKnow Your Rites\\nKimberly Hahn.\\n-------------------\\nSaturday Morning\\nApologetics Means Never Having to Say You\\'re Sorry\\nKarl Keating\\n\\nC.S.

The question is, shall we be a\\n>melting pot, boiling ourselves down to one \"legitimate\" expression, or\\n>shall we be more like a stew, maintaining the textural integrity of the\\n>expressed diversity while upholding the unity of thought?   It released\\n>all churches from the use of the Latin Mass (unity) to allow them to\\n>speak to the people in the common language (diversity). \\n\\nIn Revelation 2-3, we see that in the first century church, there was one\\ncongregation in each major city.  So there was one unified church.  Now in\\neach city, there were people of different cultures.  Naturally, they\\nformed something of a stew, with different members having different\\nheritages.  Nevertheless, they were ONE body.  They met together,\\nsometimes as smaller groups in their homes and sometimes in bigger groups\\nin places such as the temple courts.\\n\\nNow in a particular city, then and now, you will find that there is a\\ncommon language associated with that region.  For instance, in Rome, Latin\\nwas spoken.  In the United States today, English is spoken.  So it would\\nmake sense that congregations in different cities would speak the common\\nlanguage and not necessarily Latin.\\n\\nNaturally, you would expect the lead evangelist to preach in the common\\nlanguage.  In the first century church, there were probably many people\\nin the congregation who could speak a given tongue to translate the\\nmessage for people of foreign ethnic groups.  Today, however, you don\\'t\\nsee people speaking in tongues to translate sermons, even in so-called\\nPentacostal churches.  We do have a modern day equivalent though --\\nbi-lingual speakers.  Now in the unified church of which I am a member -\\nsometimes called the International Churches of Christ, when we all meet\\ntogether on Sundays, there are headphones on people who don\\'t speak\\nEnglish from which they hear an ongoing translation of the sermon in their\\nnative tongue.  Neat idea, huh?\\n\\nNow, we meet in different size groups in a random sort of way on Sundays,\\nso sometimes there will be a meeting of only Haitians or of Spanish-\\nspeaking people, for example, who will hear an evangelist preach in their\\nnative language.  In addition, we meet in small groups a couple of times\\nduring the week for Bible discussion groups and Devotionals.  So someone\\nwho speaks a different language will almost always be with people who also\\nspeak his language (assuming the congregation is large enough) for those\\nmeetings.\\n\\nAs for the people who speak the common language, they can keep in touch\\nwith their culture, if they want, but they will also have equally deep\\nfriendships among their church relationships with people of many various\\nnationalities.  \\n\\n>Has the purpose of the church been thwarted by this action?\\n\\nThe action of letting Catholics worship in a native language instead of\\nLatin?  Indeed not!  See my second paragraph in response to the second\\nclipping of your article.\\n\\nHowever, if you mean the action of forming denominations based on a\\nculture, then the purpose of the church has been indeed thwarted.\\n\\nI\\'ll assume the second possiblility when answering your next clipping.\\n\\n>Rather I believe it has been enhanced, for Paul exhorts us to become as\\n>one of them that we might reach them. Thus, if a person or group of\\n>people feel more comfortable \"among their own\", shall we not give them a\\n>place where they can feel comfortable [with their heritage] and still\\n>l[ove God?] {[my guess - Aaron]}\\n\\nYou have met some needs of people, certainly, by helping them to be proud\\nof their cultural heritages when most denominations didn\\'t.  Yet you have\\nlargely isolated yourselves from having quality \"Christian\" friendships\\noutside your nationality (and your denomination).\\n\\nWe shall certainly give people a place to feel comfortable with their\\nheritage.  However, we will do this in a way that does not destroy church\\nunity, but rather encourages friendships among all disciples.\\n\\n>This is the approach of some of the groups that you cite. \\n\\nIt sounds like these groups have wonderful intentions, but they are going\\nabout things in the wrong way.  And names like the African Methodist\\nEpiscopal Church still make me cringe, although not as much as before.\\n\\nI understand that there was more racism in the past that caused such\\ngroups to be formed, but now we should try to unite.  I know that it\\'s\\nhard for many people on this newsgroup to imagine there being only one\\nbody of people on earth, but it is quite possible, and I am working to\\nmake it happen.  However, what might be a smaller step towards unity,\\nwould be taking the word \"African\" out of your denomination\\'s name.  Then\\nperhaps someday a long time off, you can also remove the \"Methodist\\nEpiscopal\" part also, and simply be part of \"the Church\".\\n\\n>With regard to inclusivity, I note tht your .sig emits from MIT.

Dept. - New Mexico Tech\\nLines: 46\\nNntp-Posting-Host: baltic\\n\\n\\n\\tFor a very long time I've had a problem with feeling really awful\\nwhen I try to get up in the morning.  My sleep latency at night is also\\npretty long,  ranging from 30 min to an hour.  I get about 7 hours of\\nbedtime (maybe 6 of actual sleep) a night and more on the weekends.  I\\nwill spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if I can,  because\\nI feel so tired when I wake up,  even more tired than I was when I\\nwent to bed,  which is usually too tired to work.\\n\\n\\tAnyway,  I recently had a really bad flu,  so I called a friend to\\nget me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant;\\nbut he got Vicks formula 44M which has everything but an expectorant.  So\\nI used that anyway,  and the three nights I used it,  I fell asleep rapidly\\nand felt that I got really good quality sleep -- that is,  I actually\\nfelt refreshed the next morning.\\n\\n\\tSo,  I am now trying to look into,  both in the literature and\\nexperimentally,  the use of antihistamines as sleep aids,  since I am\\npresuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect.  The\\nantihistamine in Vicks formula 44 is Chloriphenamine maleate,  so I bought\\nsome generic tablets of that,  and tried one last night and didn't\\nnotice any improvement.  I might try one with a little alcohol (about\\n1 beer) to see if it is a synergism effect.  Also,  library research\\nseems to show that Benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest\\nsedative effect of what is availible OTC.  So I might also buy a generic\\nform of that and try that;  the PDR seems to suggest that 50 mg is a good\\ndosage level to try.\\n\\n\\tFor other medical information,  I have allergies but rarely have\\nan allergic reaction living in New Mexico.  I also have chronically dry\\neyes,  which get horrible if I try to use most underarm deoderants.  I did\\nguess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia,  so I made some\\nchanges in my diet consistent with that,  and it didn't help,  so I\\nwent back to a normal diet (Pretty diverse,  also taking vitamin supplements)\\n\\n\\tAnyway,  I am looking for advice for the use of\\nantihistamines as sleep aids,  and if there are any dangers of such use\\n(Seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by\\nmillions).  I don't want to try BZs,  because BZ addiction seems to be\\na serious threat,  and from what I hear,  BZ sleep quality is not good,\\nwhereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me.  I have\\ntried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff,  and that also seems to\\nlower sleep quality,  I seem to wake up around 4:00 or so and be in some\\nkind of mental haze until 7:00 or 8:00.  Also,  I would be interested in\\nany other advice for helping my problem.  (Although I've already tried\\nmany of the non-pharmacological solutions)\\n\" ------------> sci.med\n",

God\\'s experience of time is so completely different from our own,\\nsince He is both within and without it.  Using words like \"foreknowledge\"\\nand \"predestination\" are semantically incorrect when it comes to describing\\nGod\\'s perception of our action, because, for God, the beginning, living, and\\nending of our lives are all the same.  Sort of.  For God, there is no \"before\"\\nwhen He did not know, so he could not have \"foreknowledge\" of our lives or\\na time when he could have \"predestined\" our actions.  In fact, since our\\nunderstanding of things is so tied to our linear experience of time, I\\nwould say that it is impossible for us to understand completely how our\\nfree will interacts with God\\'s control of the universe.\\n\\nTom Ault\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

These blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation\\n(GI tract, mouth, vagina and sinus cavity).  Knocking down the bacterial \\ncompetition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida \\nblooms.

L. \\nacidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily \\nresponsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free.  Most of \\nthe commercial yogurt sold in the U.S. has a very low L. acidophilus and L. \\nbulgaricus count.  Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are \\nmuch more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem.  Gordon R. has told \\nme through e-mail that he gives his patients L. acidophilus and several \\ndifferent obligate anaerobes(which set-up shop in the colon) but he hasn\\'t \\ntold me which ones yet.  The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative \\nanaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a \\nchance(mouth, anus, sinus cavity and vagina).  Having these good bacteria \\naround will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal \\nregion or the vagina.  I have not proposed a systemic action for candida \\nblooms.  I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from \\nthe evil yeast blooms in the body.  I\\'m not ready to buy that yet.  I do \\nbelieve that complications at specific sites(vagina, anal and maybe lower \\ncolon, sinus and mouth) can result from antibiotic use which removes the \\ncompeting bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked.\\nRestoring the right bacterial balance is the best way(in my opinion) to get \\nrid of the problem.  Anti-fungals, a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A \\nsupplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the \\ngood bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the \\npH to basically starve the candida out.\\n\\n\\nMarty B.\\n' ------------> sci.med\n",

Schechter et al. conclude that HIV has a key role in CD4  \\ndepletion and AIDS based on epidemiological correlations with  antibodies \\nagainst HIV and with self reported recreational drug  use among homosexuals \\nfrom Vancouver.  However, their survey  neglects to disprove Duesberg\\'s drug-\\nAIDS hypothesis, because it  does not provide controls--i.e., confirmed drug-\\nfree AIDS  cases--and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores AZT  \\nuse altogether.  To refute Duesberg\\'s hypothesis Schechter would  have to \\nproduce a controlled study demonstrating that over a  period of up to 10 years \\nHIV-positive patients who use  recreational drugs or AZT or both have the same \\nAIDS risks as  positives who do not do so.

State health officials believe the TB is also  spreading because \\nthose who are most susceptible are the least  likely to follow through with \\ntreatment.  In addition, the  increase is attributed to a shortage of public \\nhealth services.   In New York City, TB is an epidemic \"because the number of \\ncases  is increasing faster than we can treat people,\" said Dr. George  \\nDiferdinando, director of the New York State TB Control.   According to \\nDiferdinando, curbing the spread of TB entails  keeping 85 percent or more of \\ndiagnosed TB cases in treatment.   About 40 percent of infected New York City \\nresidents don\\'t  complete therapy.  When TB patients don\\'t finish taking their  \\nmedication, multi-drug resistant TB can develop, which requires  taking more \\nexpensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to \\ntreat.\\n ================================================================    \\n \"Increasing Frequency of Heterosexually Transmitted AIDS in  Southern \\nFlorida: Artifact or Reality?\" American Journal of Public Health (04/93) Vol. \\n83, No. 4, P. 571  (Nwanyanwu, Okey C. et al.) \\n\\n     The alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired AIDS cases in \\nsouthern Florida was partially related to misclassification of  risk, write \\nOkey C. Nwanyanwu et al. of the Centers for Disease  Control in Atlanta, Ga.  \\nThe researchers investigated 168 such  AIDS cases from Broward and coastal \\nPalm Beach counties.  All of  these cases attributed to heterosexual \\ntransmission reported  sexual contact with bisexual men, injecting drug users, \\nor  persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the  primary route \\nof HIV transmission.  Medical records of patients,  in addition to records \\nfrom social services, HIV counseling and  testing centers, and sexually \\ntransmitted disease (STD) clinics  were reviewed.  If no other HIV risk factor \\nwas found from  medical record review, patients were interviewed using a  \\nstandardized questionnaire.  Once STD clinic and other medical  records were \\nreviewed, 29 men and 7 women were reclassified into  other HIV transmission \\ncategories.  After adjustments were made  for the reclassification, the \\npercentage of AIDS cases reported  from Palm Beach and Broward counties \\nbetween January 1, 1989, and March 31, 1990, that was attributed to \\nheterosexual transmission  decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent among men \\nand from 33  percent to 28 percent among women.  While the percentage of  \\nheterosexually transmitted AIDS cases in southern Florida  decreased after \\nadjustment was made for reclassified cases, it  still remained above the \\nnational average, the researchers  conclude.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n\\n\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n                                AIDS Statistics\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n\\n                            World Health Organization, Geneva\\n                        Organisation mondiale de la Sante, Geneve\\n\\n                              WEEKLY EPIDEMIOLOGICAL RECORD\\n                           RELEVE EPIDEMIOLOGIQUE HEBDOMADAIRE\\n\\n15 January 1993 -

I think it is one of the best articles that I\\'ve\\nread todate from the conservative position.  I can\\'t post it all at once, so it\\nwill come piece meal and not daily.

Some restrict the term\\'s meaning to \"active male\\nprostititute,\" but stronger evidence supports a more general translation,\\nnamely \"homosexuals.\"  More recently the definition \"homosexual\" has been\\nopposed on clutural and linguistic grounds, the claim being that the term\\n\"homosexuals\" is anachronistic.  In addition, criticism of the traditional\\nrendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles, excludes\\nheterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts, and includes female homosexuals. \\nA concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the only\\nfactor in the ancient world.  The foregoing oppositition to the translation of\\narsenokoitai by \"homosexuals\" has a number of debilitating weaknesses. \\nFinally, this study argues that Paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it\\nfrom the LXX of Lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual orientation\\nand behavior, the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline\\n(I Cor 5-6) and legislation in society (1 Tim 1:8-11).\\n\\n                      *************************************\\n\\n                                   INTRODUCTION\\n\\n     Coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years has\\nbeen an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality or\\nsodomy.    As part of this focus, the meaning of the term arsenokoitai, used\\ntwice by the apostle Paul (1 Cor 6:9,  I Tim 1:10), has received vigorous\\nscrutiny.    This issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society since\\nso much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements.  More particularly, \\nthe concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the church\\nand in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation.\\n\\n     This study of historical, linguistic, and literary matters will survey and\\nevalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidence\\nto point to a resolution.  Several writers and their positions represent the\\nmodern debate on this word.  Three authors, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs, have\\nprovoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wider\\nacceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society, in the church, and in the\\nministry. \\n\\n\\nFootnotes:\\n_______________________\\n 1.  For convenience sake, the term \"homosexual\" is used to encompass both\\nsame-sex orientation and same-sex behavior.  The meaning of this term is one of\\nthe main considerations of this study.\\n 2. These times are differnt from just over a century ago.  Then P Fairbairn\\n(Pastoral Epistles [Edinburg, 1874)  891) could write of arsenokoitai thit it\\nis a \"term for which fortunately our language has no proper equivalent.\" \\nUnknowingly he thereby touched upon the basis for the contemporary debate and\\nstudy.  THe present writer endorses the Pauline authorship of the Pastoral\\nEpistles on the basis of internal and external evidence (see Donald Guthrie,\\nNew Testament Introduction, [4th ed;  1990] 621-649, for an extensive\\ndiscussion and citation of supporters of the Pauline authorship).\\n 3. For example, see Scroggs\\' influence on M. Olson, \"Untangling the Web,\" The\\nOther Side (April 1984): 24-29.  For a study suggesting a further prohibition\\nof homosexuality in the OT, see A. Phillips, \"Unconvering the Father\\'s Skirt,\"\\nVT 30/1 (Jan, 1980) 38-43.  For a bibliography of other sources dealing with\\narsenokoitai, see the Wisondisc Religion Indexes (NY: H.

This difficulty of\\ntranslating prophetic vision into a concrete when and where has always been\\ndifficult, even for the prophets of old.  That is why their prophecies are\\nso often subject to multiple interpretations.  Likewise, the Apostles seemed\\nto feel that the return of the Lord was to be \"very soon\" in the sense of\\nperhaps the same generation. Yet the meaning of \"very soon\" has proven to\\nbe different than they could grasp.  Prophetic vision tends to telescope\\ntime, so that things that are far off appear to be very close.\\n\\nAnother possibility is that the vision was one of a real event preparing to\\nhappen, again in the realm of the potential-but-not-yet-manifest and which\\nwas thwarted by other forces, including possibly an act of divine mercy.\\n\\nThere are many concrete prophecies being made these days by devout and\\nsincere and sober Christians (and others too).  It seems that great coming \\nevents are really casting their shadow before their arrival in these \\n\"apocalyptic\" times.  The various predictions (I\\'m talking about those that\\nappear to be sincere and sober) are hard to accept, yet hard to ignore com-\\npletely.  One has the feeling \"something is about to start to get ready to \\nbegin to commence to happen\".  We are living, as the Chinese saying goes,\\nin interesting times.\\n\\nAs for how to discriminate, the Bible doesn\\'t help much.  There is an Old\\nTestament passage (I forget where it is) that says you will know whether\\na prophet is true by whether or not his prophecy comes to pass.  That\\nhelps eliminate the failures after the fact, but in the case of an earth-\\nquake it is small comfort.  It seems to me that all prophecies that give\\nspecific times and places and events should be suspect, not in that they\\nare necessarily false, but in the sense stated above, that all such visions\\nare subject to mistranslation from the plane of prophetic vision to the\\nplane of earthly time and space.\\n\\nFor what it is worth, Rudolf Steiner once was asked whether a modern initiate \\ncould see into the future and predict coming events.  His answer was that \\nit would be possible but then he would have to withdraw from active parti-\\ncipation in them, including proclaiming what he saw.  If this is in fact\\na spiritual law, then the answer to your question about how to discriminate\\nis that the one who makes such prophecies is probably violating that law,\\nknowingly or unknowingly, and as such his message should be considered\\na priori to be dubious.  I.e. I would expect that those capable of making\\ntrue predictions and giving accurate expression to them would not do so in \\nthe way that the prophet of the Oregon earthquake did.  However, I can\\nsympathize with the person who published the prophecy. Given the same\\noverwhelming experience that he apparently had,  I too might feel impelled, \\nand even commissioned by God to tell my fellow human beings about what \\nI had seen.\\n\\nGerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)\\n\\n\\n[Do any of our church historian readers know whether there\\'s any\\nmore prophecy now than there has been in the past?  I don\\'t get\\nthat impression.  --clh]\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

Acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the \\nfrequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the \\ncandida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and L. acidophilus \\nshould be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the \\nintestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to \\noxygen(just like it does in the vagina).  As much stuff as there is in the \\nlay press about L. acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections, I\\'m really \\namazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out.\\n\\n\\nThe calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all \\nconventional wisdom out the window.  Where would medicine be if \\nconventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard \\nmedical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials?\\nThe clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene(and a very \\nimportant one).  The lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria \\nafter antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason \\nto dismiss it out-of-hand, especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply \\nand safely(like it is in animal husbandry).\\n\\nMarty B.\\n\\n' ------------> sci.med\n",

Three\\n + times I besought the Lord about this, that it should leave me;\\n + but he said to me, \"My grace is sufficient for you, for my\\n + power is made perfectr in weakness.\"\\n\\nHe does not explain what it was, but it need not have been a moral\\nproblem.  One guess is that Paul had a disorder of the eyes. He\\nordinarily dictated his letters, and then added a personal note and\\nhis signature. At the end of the letter to the Galatians, he says,\\n\"See, I am writing in large letters with my own hand,\" or else, \"See\\nwhat a long letter I have written with my own hand.\" If the former\\ntranslation is adopted, it seems that Paul could not write in the\\nsmall script of a practiced writer, but needed to make his letters\\nlarger, and this suggests eye problems. Again, he says to the\\nGalatians (4:13-15),\\n\\n + You know that it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached\\n + the gospel to you at first; and although my condition was a trial\\n + to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me as an\\n + angel of God.... For I bear you witness that, if possible, you\\n + would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.\\n\\nPerhaps this last line means simply, \"You would have done anything\\nfor me, not withholding your most precious possessions (your eyes).\"\\nBut in that case, we would expect some wording like, \"If I had\\nneeded them.\" \"If it were possible\" sounds as though the bodily\\nailment was connected with his eyes.\\n\\nWilliam Barclay, in his volume on Acts, makes a more specific\\nsuggestion.  Before Paul preached in the highlands of Galatia, he\\nhad been preaching in the coastal areas of Asia Minor.

Put another way, the question is whether homosexual\\nintercourse is the only act that Christians are supposed to believe\\nis immoral solely on the basis that God says it is, with no insight\\nbeing offered as to *why* it is immoral. No one could answer my\\nquestion in either form from the Bible. (I did get an interesting\\nresponse based on Roman Catholic theology).\\n\\nHowever, I think now that I can at least answer my first question.\\nLink Hudson pointed me to it in his recent comments about sleeping\\nwith one\\'s aunt. Incest is held to be immoral in every society,\\nthat is, there are some degrees of relationship where marriage\\n(and thus, intercouse) is prohibited. The Bible is no exception.\\nThe trouble is that it may be difficult to see *why* a particular\\nrelationship qualifies as incestuous. Societies differ as to\\nhow they define incest. Genetic reasons are sometimes offered, but\\nall the Biblical cases cannot be dealt with that way. Why can\\'t\\na man sleep with his step mother--assuming that his father is\\ndead and that he has \"married\" her? How does this case differ\\nfrom the *duty* to marry one\\'s brother\\'s childless wife.\\n\\nAre these two cases parallel? Does the Bible prohibit some incestuous\\nmarriages and homosexual marriages for the same reason, perhaps\\nthat God knows they are not good for us and yet we are incapable\\nof understanding why.\\n\\nP.S. Please don\\'t bother writing me to tell me that I am a homophobe,\\nas some did last time. My mind is not made up on these questions.\\nYou don\\'t know whether I am homophobic or not.

Joseph and Nebucadnezzar are two examples\\nof people in the Bible who received dreams from the Lord.  \\n\\nRegarding out of body experiences, this is something that we have to be\\ncareful with.  What is called an OOBE can be spiritual in nature, especially\\nif what one saw is the same as an experience witnessed by someone else.\\nChristians should certainly avoid any occult activity that would generate\\nan out of body experience.  Some things that might be called an OOBE\\nmight actually be from the Lord.

I can easily understand why someone would go\\nthat route, and would be hostile to ever coming back.\\n\\nIMHO, many of the former-Christians-turned-atheists-who-are-now-actively-\\nhostile-to-Christianity are so because their experience with Christ and God\\nwasn\\'t a very peaceful one, but one of mind-control and \"shut-up-and-do-what-\\nyou\\'re-told-because-we-know-what\\'s-best-for-you-because-it\\'s-God\\'s-will-and-\\nyou\\'re-to-young-to-know-what-God\\'s-will-is-yet\" courtesy of some of Christ\\'s\\nmore overzealous followers.  \\n\\nA final reason why people become atheists is because Christians do not have a\\nvery good reputation right now.  One of the things that attracted people to\\nChristianity in the ancient days was the love that Christians obviously had\\nfor one another and the world around them.  Unlike the rest of the world,\\nChristian communities actively cared for their poor, and the Christian rich\\ndid not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers, but bent down to help\\nthem.  Christians were known for living exemplary lives, even if they were\\nthought to be traitors to the state because they wouldn\\'t sacrifice to the\\nemporer.  Nowadays, courtesy of the media and some Christian leaders who lost\\nChrist on their way to power, people see Christians as sexually-repressed\\nhippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of \\ntheir own moral view.\\n\\nThere are a lot more reasons why people become atheists, but I don\\'t have time\\nto go into them right now.\\n\\n\\n\\nTom Ault\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

He instituted the Sacraments as the means by\\nwhich this life is given to people, and its increase fostered.\\n\\nThe absence of sanctifying grace at death means automatic exclusion\\nfrom Heaven.  The nature of Heaven is such that it\\'s impossible for a\\nhuman being to have any part in it without the gift of sanctifying\\ngrace.  To use my example, it would be like taking that rock and\\nattempting to hold a conversation with it: rocks cannot talk.  Neither\\ncan human beings live in Heaven without sanctifying grace.\\n\\nThis all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults, since\\nboth have souls.  Infants must be baptized, therefore, or they cannot\\nenter into Heaven.  They too need this form of life in them, or they\\ncannot enter into Heaven.\\n\\nTurning it around, infant baptism is good supporting evidence for the\\nCatholic belief in sanctifying grace.  Unless Baptism causes some\\nchange in an infant\\'s soul, there is no particular reason to insist on\\nthe practice.  Yet infant Baptism was probably practiced by the\\nApostles themselves, and was *certainly* part of the Church shortly\\nthereafter.\\n\\nThere is evidence for infant Baptism in the New Testament itself: 1\\nCor 1:16, Acts 16:15, 16:33, 18:8, also Acts 11:14.  It is known for\\nsure that at least one disciple of the Apostle John was baptized as an\\ninfant: St. Polycarp (because of a remark he makes in the acts of his\\nmartyrdom).  St. Justin Martyr mentions men and women baptized as\\ninfants.  There is direct evidence in St.  Irenaeus\\'s \"Against\\nHeresies\", and in Tertullian\\'s \"On Baptism\".  All these so far\\nmentioned are in the first 170 years after our Lord\\'s death.  After\\nthat, there starts to be tons of evidence for the practice.\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

In fact, she tells me\\nrepeatedly that I am the best friend she has in the world.  I care about\\nher very much despite the fact that I hate how she lives her life.\\n\\nIt\\'s very easy to fall into the progression you describe above.  I\\'ve\\nfelt it with my friend more than once.  There is a very important \\npart of Christianity that you\\'ve overlooked above and makes it possible\\nto \"love the sin but hate the sinner.\"  Before I look at someone\\nelse\\'s life and sin, I look to myself and am as disgusted by what I see\\nin *me* as I see in others, probably more.  Self-righteousness is\\ncontradictory to Christianity and is what makes the progression you\\ndescribe happen.  If a Christian can truthfully quote Paul and say, \"Wretched\\nman that I am!\" [Romans 7:24 (NASB)], that Christian will be able\\nto love the sinner and hate the sin.

            "\"From: abig@netcom.com (Access Bus Industry Gp)\\nSubject: ACCESS.bus (Re: ACCESS.bus Software Creator's Contest)\\nOrganization: NETCOM On-line Communication Services (408 241-9760 guest)\\nLines: 92\\n\\n\\tIntro to ACCESS.bus (RE: the ACCESS.bus Software Creator's \\n\\tContest Announcement)\\n\\nWHAT IS ACCESS.bus?\\n\\nACCESS.bus is a new open industry standard for computer \\nperipheral connectivity.  ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that \\nuses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to \\na single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or \\nkeypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR \\ngloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and \\nothers can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications \\nsuch as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, \\nMultiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more \\ncan now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts \\nPlug and Play on every PC.\\n\\nThe ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of \\nsystems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host \\ncomputer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a \\nnumber of device types lead to simplified hardware and software \\ndevelopment.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross-\\nplatform use of the same device.\\n\\nACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:\\n=====================================\\n\\nACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone \\nto implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without \\nfee or royalty.\\nACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single \\nhost can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus \\ndata rate is 100 Kbits/sec.\\n\\nACCESS.bus Physical Layer\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware \\nprotocol, with one data line and one clock line.\\nStandard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level \\nhandshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock \\nsynchronization.  \\n\\nACCESS.bus Software Protocols\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nThe ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three \\nlevels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.\\n\\nI2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines \\narbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C \\nprovides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with \\ndifferent clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing, \\nframing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the \\nreceiver.  \\n\\nBASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between \\na host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the \\nACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an \\nACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with \\nadditional semantics, including checksum.\\nUnique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot \\nplugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus \\naddresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot \\nplugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the \\nsystem is running, without rebooting.\\n\\nAPPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus \\nprotocol which defines message semantics specific to particular \\ntypes of devices.  Each type requires a different Application \\nProtocol.  Three broad device types have been identified: \\nkeyboards, locators, and text devices.\\n\\nACCESS.bus support on the PC\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nAll three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the \\nPC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the \\nbase protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.  \\nAn ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 \\n- controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with \\nthe ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for \\nmultiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and \\nWindows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples \\nof the interface from applications to the device drivers.\\n\\n\\nTo Contact ABIG (the ACCESS.bus Industry Group):\\n------------------------------------------------\\nPostal Address:\\n370 Altair Way, Suite 215, Sunnyvale, CA 94086\\nInternet Email:  abig@netcom.com\\nFax: (408) 991-3773\\nVoice: (408) 991-3517\\n\\n\" ------------> comp.graphics\n",

As a full color program, bit handles images of both\\n  24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.\\n\\n  As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their\\n  original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the\\n  many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using\\n  mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The\\n  SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed\\n  in full without being limited by the window or screen size.\\n\\n  As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and\\n  processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss\\n  at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing\\n  subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type\\n  whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of\\n  input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into\\n  another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple\\n  geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with\\n  the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take\\n  advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).\\n\\n  Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing\\n  image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence\\n  turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be\\n  accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image\\n  will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-\\n  nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically\\n  giving great flexibility in processing an image.\\n\\nFEATURES\\n\\n  Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a\\n  continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete, \\n  the processed image will be displayed.\\n\\n  Current features include\\n\\n  o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing\\n    and filling the \"rotated out\" region with an arbitrary color.\\n\\n  o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with\\n    the option of subpixel sampling.\\n\\n  o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an\\n    image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving\\n    the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to\\n    take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text\\n    strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as\\n    in TeX(1), e.g., $\\\\alpha$\\\\small$\\\\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha\\n    followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.\\n\\n  o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.\\n\\n  o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation\\n    function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary\\n    forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels\\n    separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of\\n    it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished\\n    rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-\\n    lability of graphical histograms of the image.\\n\\n  o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-\\n    gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at\\n    arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some\\n    user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering\\n    directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,\\n    PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions\\n    independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a\\n    circle).\\n\\n  o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-\\n    to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.\\n\\n  o Performs histogram equalization.\\n\\n  o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of\\n    arbitrary order.\\n\\n  o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.\\n\\n  o Cuts and pastes across images.\\n\\n  o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.\\n\\n  o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause\\n    interval between images. (SlideShow)\\n\\n  o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels\\n    along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities\\n    or as an intensity vs. distance plot.\\n\\n  o Performs image type conversions.\\n\\n  o Converts image formats.\\n\\n  o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).\\n\\n  o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image\\n    back and display it.\\n\\n  o Modify an individual pixel\\'s RGB values.\\n\\n  o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the\\n    resulting power spectra.\\n\\n  o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).\\n\\n SUPPORTED FORMATS\\n      o  IRIS RGB, native to SGI IRIS\\n      o  JPEG(JFIF) format\\n      o  CompuServ GIF\\n      o  PNM(Portable Any Map), including PPM, PGM and PBM.\\n      o  XBM (X Window Bitmap)\\n      o  TIFF\\n      o  PostScript(Write only)\\n\\nHardware requirements:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n   Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode(), including indigoes.\\n\\nWhere to get it:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n   anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu   /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.Z\\n   where xxx is the version number. Current version is 0.73\\n\\n   Read src/01Readme for installation instructions after unpacking\\n\\nAcknowledgement:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n   JPEG support is based on the Independent JPEG groups\\'s library Version 4.\\n   FORMS library, developed by Mark Overmars, is used for GUI.\\n   Both JPEG and FORMS library are included in this release.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n  Bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate\\n  images; The built-in editing features will satisfy most of\\n  your editing needs.

See below.\\n\\n>If slavery is immoral (which I believe it is, can I assume that everyone\\n>else in this group does too?), why doesn\\'t Jesus or any of the apostles\\n>speak out against it?

In it Paul at least hints that a\\ncertain slave be released.  Also, slavery in those times was not the\\nsame as the type of slavery we had in the U.S.  I think a better\\ncomparison would be to indentured servitude.  I don\\'t really want to get\\ninto a discussion on slavery.  Anyway, although it does demonstrate your\\npoint, I don\\'t think it is relevent, because the original poster did not\\nsay that absence of specific condemenation proves something is not\\nimmoral.\\n\\n   Back to the original poster\\'s assertion.  He is not in fact making\\nthe logical error of which you accuse him.  He stated the fact that the\\nBible does not say that babies cannot be baptized.  Also, we know that\\nthe Bible says that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven.\\n_Everyone_ includes infants, unless there is other Scripture to the\\ncontrary, i.e. an exception.  Since there is no exception listed in the\\nBible, we must assume (to be on the safe side) that the Bible means what\\nit says, that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter Heaven.  And so we\\nbaptize infants.\\n\\n   To summarize, you accused the original poster of saying if something\\nis not forbidden by the Bible, then that proves it is OK; i.e. if\\nsomething cannot be disproven, it is true.  He rather seemed to be\\nasserting that since the Bible does not forbid, _you cannot prove_,\\nusing the Bible, that it is _not_ OK.  There is a difference between\\nproving whether or not something can be proven or disproven (there are\\ntheories on provability in the field of Logic, by the way) and actually\\nproving or disproving it.  The other logical error we must avoid falling\\ninto is the converse: that if something cannot be proven, then it is\\nfalse.  This seems to be the error of many _sola scriptura_ believers.\\n\\n   I think the only thing that can be proven here is that one cannot use\\nScripture alone to prove something either way about infant Baptism,\\nalthough the evidence seems to me to favor it.\\n\\n-\\t-\\t-\\t-\\t-\\t-\\t-\\t-\\t-\\t-\\nSteve Creps, Indiana University\\ncreps@lateran.ucs.indiana.edu\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

The conference was organized by the Rensse-\\n          laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-\\n          GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-\\n          tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was\\n          represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS\\n          users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-\\n          dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and\\n          academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS\\n          users  to  \"take  charge of your PHIGS\" by participating in PHIGS\\n          standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS\\n          implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,\\n          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  \"beyond\\n          PHIGS\".\\n\\n          Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following\\n          topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,\\n          Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented\\n          Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS\\n          Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and\\n          Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed\\n          a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The\\n          conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-\\n          ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools\\n          based on PHIGS.\\n\\n          Next year\\'s conference is planned for March, 1994.\\n\\n          PHIGS EVERYWHERE\\n\\n          At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated\\n          PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to\\n          mainframes.\\n\\n          Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including\\n          conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing\\n          and translucency.\\n\\n          Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-\\n          Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.  FIGARO+  PRO  is designed to add\\n          advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like\\n          ray   tracing,  materials,  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.\\n          Radiosity support is also planned.\\n\\n          FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging\\n          graphics  features to their products.  FIGARO+ supports immediate\\n          mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL,  HP  Starbase\\n          and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.\\n\\n          TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a  powerful\\n          \"2-call\"  charting  system  based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object-\\n          oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers.\\n\\n          G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on\\n          Silicon  Graphics  workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver-\\n          sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company\\'s  PHIGS+  library  for  worksta-\\n          tions,  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS\\n          developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS\\n          internal  state.  G5G  also  described  their Non-Duplicated Data\\n          Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS\\n          for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. In addition, G5G described\\n          their application GSE that allows application callback  functions\\n          during  GPHIGS traversal.  GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G\\'s data visual-\\n          izer and application development toolkit, are currently available\\n          on  all  major  workstations  that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or\\n          Starbase.\\n\\n          Wise Software presented a slide show of  Z-PHIGS  for  MS-Windows\\n          and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render. Z-PHIGS implements most\\n          of the PHIGS+ primitives.  In addition Z-PHIGS has built in  many\\n          advanced  rendering features like texture mapping, shadow genera-\\n          tion, area quick updates and ray tracing. A demo disk of  Z-PHIGS\\n          or ARENA is available on request.\\n\\n          ATC exhibited GRAFPAK-PHIGS, their full-featured PHIGS  implemen-\\n          tation  based  on  DEC  PHIGS.

These people -- and those associated with them\\n    (\"Now there were with us seven brethren\", Matt. 22:25) -- would not\\n    be receptive to such higher blessings as eternal marriage.  Hence,\\n    the people in the story would likely not be married in the eterni-\\n    ties; but that doesn\\'t mean other, more faithful people could not\\n    have this blessing.\\n\\n(2) Jesus was making a distinction between the state or condition of\\n    =being= married, and the process of =becoming= married.  The latter\\n    activity (marrying and giving in marriage) will not take place in\\n    the eternities, because all eternal marriages will be taken care of\\n    before then.\\n\\n(3) The account as we have it (in all three of the synoptic Gospels) is\\n    missing something that would make its real meaning clearer.  Note\\n    that we (LDS) do not believe in Biblical inerrancy, so we do not in\\n    general feel obliged to reconcile each and every Bible text with\\n    modern revelation through Joseph Smith and other latter-day proph-\\n    ets.  Nor are we particularly upset that the account in question\\n    was not significantly revised in the \"Joseph Smith Translation\" or\\n    \"Inspired Version\" of the Bible, since we do not believe this work\\n    was completed or that failure to revise a passage in the JST con-\\n    stitutes divine approval of that passage as it stands in the KJV.\\n\\n-- \\nRich Wales <richw@mks.com>       //      Mortice Kern Systems Inc.

I am on an\\ninformation gathering venture regarding the various expressions of\\nChristianity/churches there are.  \\n        My husband and I come from very different, but completely\\nChristian backgrounds.  I was a Lutheran when I met him and he was a\\nborn and raised Church of Christ member.  At first I agreed with a lot\\nof what the C of C was about, I wanted to move from the liturgical\\nbased Lutheran church to something a little more Biblical based.\\nHowever over the last year, I\\'ve been regretting changing to the\\nChurch of Christ for a number of reasons - for one thing I am not a\\nfundamentalist and believe that a few things in the Bible are\\nsocio-cultural in nature and don\\'t relate to the Christian doctrine.\\nOne of my sorest spots is the role of women.  I believe that through\\nMary and other women, Chris validated women as worthy disciples - but\\nin the C of C the writings of Paul are taken without exception and I\\nam told that I am not an equal partner in my marriage but the lesser\\nmember, I am to submit to my husband in all things (if I hear that\\nverse one more time....) and I am not to take an active role in\\nanything which might be construed as putting me in authority over men\\n(ie leading prayers, conducting Bible studies etc).   The last straw\\nwas when the Elders at our church came down on one of our college\\ngroups because it was all-women and they wanted a man to lead the\\nstudy.\\nAlso my husband and I really resent the way everyone at our church\\nfeels that if you aren\\'t a conservative republican - you aren\\'t a REAL\\nChristian (I got told that nobody who voted for Clinton should call\\nthemselves a Christian).  Hence we are subjected during the service to\\nlong prayers calling for things we flatly dont agree with.  We are\\nalso don\\'t agree with the C of C\\'s dread of any new \"movement\" being\\nled by the young people.\\n\\nSo, we have been church hunting with NO success.  I want a reasonably\\nbiblical based church where women are viewed as whole people no matter\\nwhat their calling ( C of C really looked down on career women).\\nChristopher is looking for a church with deeply rooted religious\\nconvictions, with adult baptism and a church where the members still\\nbring their Bibles to service.\\n\\nWe are so confused here and we\\'re drifting around trying to find a\\nplace where we both feel loved and can express our faith honestly and\\nwithout reservation.  If anyone can point us in a direction we\\'d be\\nthrilled!\\nI\\'m afraid that it will be very hard for me to go back to C of C and\\neven harder for me to stay churchless for long.\\n\\nany responses would be welcome\\n\\n\\nthe diel family\\n\\n[I would think somewhere in the Baptist spectrum you might find what\\nyou\\'re looking for.

As the\\nprevious discussion of the Trinity did not lend itself to an exchange\\nof flames, I am hopeful that this will also not produce major\\nflames.\\n\\nRegards,\\n--\\nLarry Autry\\nSilicon Graphics, St. Louis\\nautry@sgi.com \\n\\n\\n\\n[Often we get into discussions about who is Christian.  Unfortunately\\nthere are a number of possible definitions.  Starting from the \\nbroadest, commonly used definitions are:\\n\\n  a historical definition\\n  people who accept Christ as Lord and savior\\n  a broad doctrinal definition\\n  narrow doctrinal definitions\\n\\n1) By a historical definition I mean the sort of definition a secular\\nhistorian would likely use.  This would include any group that\\ndeveloped out of the Christian church, and continues within the same\\nbroad culture.  E.g. some Unitarians would fail just about any\\ndoctrinal test you could come up with.  Yet it\\'s clear that that group\\ndeveloped from Christianity, and people from very different\\nbackgrounds (e.g. Hindus) would likely see them as part of\\nChristianity.  This is not a definition most Christians like, but it\\'s\\nrelevant in some political and ethnic contexts.\\n\\n2) Accepting Christ as Lord and savior is a test used by many\\nChristian groups for membership, e.g. the Southern Baptists and\\nPresbyterian Church (USA).  I would qualify it by saying that what\\nmost people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to Christ, so that\\nsomeone who accepted Christ as one of many gods would not fit.  It\\'s\\nan attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based\\non technical doctrine.  By this definition, groups such as Arians\\nwould be viewed as heretical Christians, but still Christians.  In the\\nmodern context this would include Mormons, JW\\'s, and \"oneness\\nPentecostals\".  They would be viewed as heretical Christians, but\\nstill Christian.  In practice I believe just about everyone who falls\\ninto this category would accept the Apostle\\'s Creed.\\n\\n3) The next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition,\\nwhich includes all of the major strands of Christianity, but excludes\\ngroups that are felt to be outside \"historic Christianity.\"  This is\\nof course a slippery enterprise, since Catholics could argue that\\nProtestants are outside historic Christianity, etc.  But I think the\\nmost commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the\\nNicene Creed and the Formula of Chalcedon.  The attempt is to\\ncharacterize doctrines that all major strands of Christianity agree\\nare key.  Obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement.  A\\nMormon will regard the LDS church as a major strand, and thus will not\\nwant to include anything that contradicts their beliefs.  But I think\\nthis definition would have fairly broad acceptance.\\n\\n4) Finally, some people use definitions that I would say are limited\\nto a specific Christian tradition.  E.g. some evangelicals only\\nconsider someone Christian if he has had an evangelical-style\\nconversion experience, and some I\\'ve even heard of groups that limit\\nit to their specific church.\\n\\nI think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used.\\nA lot is going to depend upon the purpose you\\'re using it for.  If\\nyou\\'re using it descriptively, e.g. in history or anthropology, you\\'ll\\nprobably use definition 1 or 2.  If you\\'re using it normatively, i.e.\\nto say what you believe the Christian message is, you\\'ll probably use\\na definition like 3 or even 4.\\n\\n--clh]\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

I\\'ve never quite understood\\nthe trinity thing. On the one hand, Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate. But,\\nat the same time, he is God\\'s son \"For God so loved the world that he gave his\\nonly begotten son\". First question is, if Jesus was God in human form, how could\\nhe really be God\\'s son? If the Holy Ghost \"planted the seed\" in Mary, so to speak,\\nthen it seems that Jesus\\' relationship to God would be the equivalent to the\\nhuman father/son relationship. While a son might inherit alot of the father\\'s \\nqualities, he is not the father. They are still two separite entities. To try\\nand say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. In that\\ncase, Jesus and God aren\\'t the same. On the other hand, if their relationship\\nisn\\'t the same as the human father/son relationship, but Jesus is actually God\\nincarnate, then he\\'s not really God\\'s son and he never was. He\\'s just God\\nmanifesting himself as Jesus. At least, this is how I\\'m seeing it. Can someone\\nwho is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us? \\n\\nGetting back to the original question, what is the great price that Jesus paid\\nto redeem our sins? Was it dying on the cross? Since Jesus knew that he would\\nrise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven, I have a hard time seeing\\nhow this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. His earthly body\\nmay have been killed, but then, so what? He suffered a few hours of physical\\npain, but then, there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more.\\nThe fact that Jesus was God\\'s only begotten son doesn\\'t seem to me to have much\\nmeaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to. Jesus being the only\\none was simply a matter of choice. I suspect that these questions will be very\\noffensive to many Christians on this net. To those people, please accept my\\nsincere apologies. It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ.\\nBut, I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious.\\n \\n[Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together.\\nFirst, your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one.  (In this\\ngroup, it\\'s dangerous to say that no one believes something.)  You\\nseem to be suggesting the Jesus is God\\'s son in a physical sense,\\nwith the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother.  I consider that\\nterrible heresy, though some people react less violently.  The Virgin\\nBirth says that Jesus\\' birth is God\\'s responsibility.  But it doesn\\'t\\nimply that God\\'s sperm was involved.  Indeed one (though by no means\\nthe only) speculation is that God used Joseph\\'s genetic material.\\n\\nSecond, Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father.  In a\\nTrinitarian context, the term Son refers to the eternal Logos, who is\\na part of God.  The Son didn\\'t come into existence with Jesus\\' birth.\\nJesus is the incarnation of the Son.  So his sonness isn\\'t\\nspecifically a result of being incarnated.  Rather, it\\'s the Son\\nwho was incarnated.\\n\\n--clh]\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

Some studies suggest \\nthat early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial \\nbecause exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and \\nmortality(mumps, measles. etc.).\\n\\n> -- How often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sick?\\n> How often do they get colds, flus, ear infections?

But many viruses \\nmutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response(\\nnew antibody production).  In addition, antibody levels tend to decline \\nwith time and re-innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high.\\nChronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression \\nbut this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children.\\n\\n> -- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long\\n> term effects?\\n\\nYes, chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good \\nbacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body.  Health effects \\nof this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the \\nmedical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects \\nof chronic antibiotic use( a view that I do not support).\\n \\n> -- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than\\n> normal, and what does one do about it?\\n\\nChronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my \\nopinion).  But most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is \\nnormal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many \\ninfectious diseases.  I do not share this view and there are some \\nphysicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection \\nfrequency and severity.  Exposure to an infectious agent does not have to \\nresult in a severe infection.  A strong immune response can minimize the \\nlength of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms \\nassociated with the infection.\\n\\n> -- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?\\n\\nThere are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong \\nimmune response to infectious agents.  They are: protein, vitamin C, \\nvitamin A, iron and zinc.  The American diet is not low in protein so this \\nis rarely a problem.  But vitamin A, vitamin C, iron and zinc are often low \\nand this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune \\nresponse.  Iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin A).  There are \\ndistinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of \\nthese nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe \\ninfection.  Serum ferritin for iron status, dark adaptation for vitamin A \\nstatus, red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for \\nvitamin C status.  I have attempted to work up posts on these five \\nnutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the \\nothers that I participate in.  I can e-mail you what I\\'ve worked up so far.\\nBut my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the \\ncritical role that diet plays in the human immune response.  You may also \\nbe able to get help from a nutritionist.  Anyone can call themselves a \\nnutritionist so you have to be very carefull.  You want to find someone(\\nlike myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition.\\nMany Ph.D. programs in the U.S. now offer degrees in Nutrition and that\\'s \\nwhat you need to look for.  Some dieticians will also call themselves \\nnutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training \\nneeded to run specialized nutritional assessment tests.  They are very good \\nfor getting general dietary advice from however.\\n\\n> Any data, information or advice relating to this would be much\\n> appreciated.

Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.\\n\\n   If you don\\'t find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn\\'t set up\\n   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the\\n   problem.\\n\\n3.

There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article\\n   \"Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup\" carries a list of these\\n   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.\\n\\n5. If you don\\'t have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu\\n   consisting of the following lines:\\n\\n      send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/faq\\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction\\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/logic\\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/resources\\n\\n5.

(Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the\\n   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this\\n   if you\\'ve tried the above methods and they\\'ve failed; it\\'s not nice to\\n   clutter the newsgroup or people\\'s mailboxes with requests for files.\\n   it\\'s better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!

And to be honest\\n>with you, I\\'m beginning to wish that it was never written.\\n\\nI agree with this consensus that it should not have been written the way\\nit was.  My doctor - who claims to have introduced Dr. Crook to the\\npossibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in\\n1961 (I have no reason to doubt him on this) - does not like the book\\nbecause 1) it makes too many unfounded claims, and 2) is horribly written\\nfrom a scientific viewpoint.  On the other hand, my doctor has always kept\\nan open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the \"yeast\\nconnection\".\\n\\nBut, I believe there is some truth to the book.  Hopefully the right\\nclinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction.  In\\nthe meantime, I\\'d still encourage people who have \"incurable\" chronic sinus\\nproblems (especially if they overused antibiotics), to find a doctor to\\nadminister a systemic-type anti-fungal such as itraconazole (along with\\nliver panels before, during and after treatment just to play it safe).  It\\nis an empirical approach for sure, but when all else fails, and your ENT\\nsays \"sorry, you\\'ll just have to live with it\", it is time to step out and\\ntry an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence\\n(Dr. Ivker), supported by plausible theories (outlined by Marty).  At\\nthis stage you have little to lose, particularly if you use itraconazole and\\nhave the proper monitoring - the health risk has been shown through extensive\\nclinical studies both in Europe and the U.S. to be very minimal with\\nrelatively healthy (i.e., non-AIDS) patients.  I\\'m glad I did this, since I\\nsaw remarkable results after only one week on Sporanox (itraconazole).  Of\\ncourse, your mileage may vary a lot - everyone is different so it may not\\nwork for you.

Computer  graphics has played  a\\ndecisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to\\nbuild, visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects.\\n \\nWhile computer scientists are conversant in the language of their\\nown discipline, they are often unfamiliar with the terminology,\\nsimulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists.\\nSimilarly, chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms\\nand technological advances in graphical computing.\\n \\nThis interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap\\nbetween computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry\\nresearchers who wish to be more than just casual users of\\nprepackaged graphics software. Although this is not intended to\\nbe a course in computational chemistry or drug design, data sets\\nfrom chemical research problems will be used in lab and students\\nwill be encouraged to bring data sets of their own.

REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION\\n\\n\\tThe Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of\\nthe rapture until Christ\\'s second coming.  Also know as \"the time of Jacob\\'s\\n(Israel\\'s) trouble\" (Jere 30:7) and \"Daniel\\'s Seventieth Week\" (Dan 9), this \\nperiod will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.\\n\\nIII. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM\\n\\n\\tSoon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community \\n(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will\\nbe tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable \\npossession during the Tribulation.\\n\\nIV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\\n\\n\\tSince all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it\\nis imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can\\nquote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, \\nRevelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to\\nunfold before you.  \\n\\nV. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE\\n\\n\\tPray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray \\nand pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual \\nstrength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the\\nsake of Christ.  \\n\\nVI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED\\nONES DIE AS MARTYRS\\n\\n\\tAfter the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he\\nwill institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,\\nor eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be\\nuseless.  \"And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and \\nslave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that\\nno one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, \\nor the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding\\ncalculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number\\nis 666\" - Revelation 13:16-18.  \\n\\tThe Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of \\nhumanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed\\nin the past, such as the Holocaust.\\n[or maybe the crusades? -M]\\nYou cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist\\'s\\nrule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) \"...I saw\\nunder the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and\\nfor the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of \\nthem: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, \\nuntil both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be\\nkilled as they were, was completed.\" Revelation 6:9, 11.\\n\\tHis targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image\\nor take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ \"...And I saw the souls of \\nthose who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of \\nGod, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark\\non their foreheads or on the hands.\" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every\\nform of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor\\nwill he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, \\ntorturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take\\nthe mark.  \\n\\tIf you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,\\nyou will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.\\n[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]\\nYou cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and\\ngain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake\\nof Fire.  \"...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his \\nmark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of\\nthe wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His \\nindignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the \\npresence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.\" -Revelation \\n14:9-10 \\n\\n[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to\\nthe first 5,000 at the stadium --M] \\n\\nVII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL\\n\\n\\tAlthough you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist\\'s government\\nuntil the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is \\nimportant for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are\\nextremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.\\n\\tThe first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or\\nmountainous area, for the Antichrist\\'s control will come last to the least\\npopulated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \\nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\\n[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\\ninto our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school\\nclosings\" --M] \\nStore water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without\\nthe mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste\\nfrom nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.\\n[Get a good water filter. --M]\\nBring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,\\nbatteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to \\nsurvive and live off the land as the pioneers did.\\n\\nVIII. TRUST NO ONE\\n\\t\\n\\tThere will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist\\'s\\ngovernment.  Be on the lookout.\\n[Perot supporters take note --M]\\n\\nIX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\\n\\n\\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \\n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \\nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \\npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \\npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\\n\\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \\nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\\n\\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\\n\\n\\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \\nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \\n\\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \\nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or\\nremain saved, but this time you will have to be \"faithful unto death.\"\\n\\n\\tMay God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!\\n\\n******************************************************************************\\nMike Cluff\\t\\t\\t\\t*  \"Christianity is Stupid.\\nv22964qs@ubvms or mike%luick@ubvms\\t*   Give up.\" -Negativland\\nUB Language Perception Laboratory\\t*  \\n******************************************************************************\\n\\n\\n/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\/\\\\ \\n\\nBob Beauchaine bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM \\n\\nThey said that Queens could stay, they blew the Bronx away,\\nand sank Manhattan out at sea.\\n\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

Our Lady appeared to\\nher and instructed her for two hours or more on matters pertaining\\nto her life and to the future of France and the world.\\n\\nOn November 27 Our Lady appeared again to Catherine. She instructed\\nher to have a medal struck. She told her that those who wore this \\nmedal would enjoy special protection from the Mother of God and would\\nreceive great graces. In less than a year there were three more\\napparitions. In June of 1831 the medals were a reality. Many reports\\nwere received by those who wore it.

It\\nwas a pleasure to read them.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nYou are welcome, Zane.\\n \\nZane...\\n\"I am sure nothing that I will say will change your mind about it... but I\\nwould like to ask you if the book in question really does anything for you.\\nI mean, were you all caught up in the word/faith thing, but now that you\\nhave read the book you\\'ve been rescued from all of the error and pain that\\nwill result in your Christian life?\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\n(1) When I first became a Christian, I entered into the Word/Faith\\n    movement.  It was easy.  I wasn\\'t grounded in the Word of God and sound\\n    doctrine.  When I visited Christian book stores, the cheapest books I\\n    could find to buy were the .50 and $1.00 books by Hagin and others.\\n    Consequently, I began receiving Hagin\\'s monthly magazine (and they\\n    still send it to me), and also Copeland\\'s (also, still sent to me).\\n    It wasn\\'t until I read a booklet by Jimmy Swaggart called _Hyper Faith:\\n    The New Gnosticism_ that I began to realize the teachings I were\\n    partaking of were error.  I started reading the Bible more and studying\\n    more.  Sure enough, Jimmy was right in many points.  As part of my\\n    experience, I am alerting Christians, particularly new Christians, that\\n    these teachings are heretical and they need to do as the Bereans did in\\n    Acts 17:11 - check these teachings out with Scripture!\\n \\n(2) My brother in law was involved in a Word/Faith \"cult\" in my area - it\\'s\\n    leader is real good friends with Benny Hinn.  Rather then going into\\n    much detail about this, suffice it to say he was deceived, mistreated, and\\n    has now fallen into atheism.  I\\'m still praying for him (Phil. 1:6).\\n \\n(3) The assistant pastor at the church I teach adult Sunday School in has been\\n    a `follower\\' of Copeland for 15 years.  He has thousands of tapes by the\\n    Faith teachers.  In the class recently, I quoted several of the teachers\\'\\n    heretical statements to his surprise.  Since then, I\\'ve been able to talk\\n    to him at length about these issues.\\n \\n(4) The leader of the Women\\'s Group at my church is a Benny Hinn `fan\\'.\\n    Recently, I found that she has been lending _Good Morning, Holy Spirit_ to\\n    women in the church.  That prompted my quotes in Sunday School, as well as\\n    my lending CIC to people in the church.\\n \\nI\\'m well aware of the abuses and heresies perpetrated in this movement and\\nhave an urgency in my heart and life to warn people about the heresies.\\nWhat heresies?\\n    A. Jesus became sin - took on the very nature of the devil, and became\\n        one with him.\\n    B. Jesus\\' death on the cross wasn\\'t enough to atone.\\n    C. Jesus was dragged to hell after His death, was beat and abused by\\n        Satan and demons, thus finishing our atonement.  Satan was ruling\\n        over Him there.\\n    D. Jesus was `born-again\\' in hell.\\n    E. Jesus died spiritually, lost His divinity, and reassumed it after\\n        the resurrection.\\n    F. We are gods.\\n \\nThese are heresies.  Documentation will be provided re: these teachings\\nupon request.\\n \\nZane...\\n\"Or what does it do for you?

But CIC is MUCH, MUCH better - tremendous\\ndocumentation and insights.\\n \\nZane...\\n\"I don\\'t have a nice Scriptural answer for why I believe it is at best un-\\nprofitable for Christians to engage in this type of activity - heresy hunting.\"\\n \\nMY REPLY...\\nWhy do you call it \"heresy hunting\"?  \"Hunting\" implies it isn\\'t readily\\naccessible or available.  This movement is the fastest growing movement in\\nChristendom.  Hagin has sold over 40 million books and booklets.

But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving\\nand being deceived. But you must continue in the things which you have learned\\nand been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from\\nchildhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise\\nfor salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

Unfortunately, heresy is being\\ntaught not just in Copeland\\'s church or Hagin\\'s or Hinn\\'s or Price\\'s, but all\\nover the radio, in print, etc.  No pastor or church leader knows what materials\\nthe sheep are feeding on outside the church.  It\\'s imperative that leadership\\nbe made aware of this, and CIC does just that.\\n \\nAlso, let\\'s examine a passage of Scripture...\\n* EPH 4:11 And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some\\nevangelists, and some pastors and teachers,\\n* EPH 4:12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the\\nedifying of the body of Christ,\\n \\nThese ministry gifts that the Lord installs in the church are not just for one\\nindividual church, but for \"the body of Christ\".\\nPaul was an apostle - he traveled all over distilling his message.  He was also\\na teacher -\\n1CO 4:17 For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and\\nfaithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach\\neverywhere in every church.\\n1CO 7:17 But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each\\none, so let him walk. And so I ordain in all the churches.\\n \\nAlso -\\n1CO 12:28 And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second\\nprophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,\\nadministrations, varieties of tongues.\\n \\n* EPH 4:13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of\\nthe Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness\\nof Christ;\\n \\nNotice that the \"Five-Fold\" ministries are going to be around \"till\" the church\\nis in \"unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a perfect\\nman\".

I love it,\\nbut I am not very familiar with the different denominations, or\\ntraditions, or common beliefs of various christian groups.\\nI have heard various people (outside this news group)\\ndescribe *idols* such as power, money, material \\npossessions etc.  These things are worshiped in some sense I \\nsuppose, but I never really gave idols much thought.  Until now...  \\n\\nI have been reading the postings in this news group (which I \\njust found a few days ago), and I have a question...  First, I\\'m\\nnot trying to question anyone\\'s belief or try to push my views\\non anyone else (I haven\\'t been at this long enough to have\\nany views other than I cannot get to heaven by being good,\\nI must understand that Christ bore my sins on the cross so that\\nI could be saved and I need to repent, i.e. realize that\\nevery time I sin, I might as well stick a sharp stick in\\nChrist\\'s side because He took the punishment for my sins,\\nwhen He died on the cross).\\n\\nIn my studies, Mary never really comes up.  I know who she is, \\nbut that\\'s about it.  It seems to me that a statue of Mary \\ncould be considered an idol?  Do people pray to statues of Mary?\\n\\nIt sounds like educated christians (more educated than myself\\nI\\'m sure) believe Mary was sinless?  Wow...  I hoped to spend\\nthe summer convincing myself (one way or the other) about\\nTongues (I\\'m reading \"Charismatic Chaos\").  I guess I\\'ll study\\nTongues in parallel with reading this news group.  Any help you can \\ngive me will be appreciated.\\n\\n    -------------------------------------------\\n\\n[I don\\'t think the issue is so much that people are more educated than\\nyou (though it may well be that they are), as that they come from a\\ndifferent tradition than yours.\\n\\nThis is a discussion between Catholics and Protestants.  Catholics\\ngenerally believe that Mary was sinless.  Protestants do not.  The\\nissue comes down to different sources of authority.  Protestants\\ngenerally limit themselves to the Bible as a source of doctrine.\\nSince this isn\\'t in the Bible (except in passages that no one would\\nunderstand in this way if they didn\\'t already believe it), Protestants\\ndon\\'t accept it.  Catholics see continuing revelation through the\\nChurch, though they believe the results are consistent with the Bible.\\n\\nI interpret your posting, not as a call for yet another argument about\\nwhether the Catholic Marian devotions are idolatry (an argument I am\\nnot prepared to see newed here), but as a sign of being interested in\\nlearning about traditions other than your own.  Catholics are of\\ncourse a major one, but by no means the only one.  I generally\\nconsider the major traditions to be Catholic, Orthodox, and\\nvarious subsets of Protestantism.  Within Protestantism, it\\'s a matter\\nof how finely you want to cut things.  These days I think the major\\ndivision is between those who accept Biblical inerrancy and those\\nwho don\\'t.  There are also a number of major historical traditions,\\nbut in recent decades distinctions are tending to blur.  I\\'d \\nidentify the major Protestant traditions as:\\n\\n  Lutheran, Reformed, Anglican (they\\'re sort of halfway between\\n  Catholic and Protestant), Wesleyan, Baptist, Holiness, Pentecostal,\\n  Church of Christ\\n\\nBut there are a number of others.  Historical distinctions tend not to\\nbe so important among the liberal churches anymore, and I think\\ncurrent trends in society and the Church are also tending to make\\nconservatives seen themselves as allies from a general \"evangelical\"\\nperspective.  But differences among these various traditions are still\\nquite marked.\\n\\nI think the best introduction to these issues is to read a good book\\non church history.  Anyone who wants to understand the church really\\nneeds to understand how we got where we are now.  A church history\\nwill normally show you where each of these traditions came from, and\\ngive a feeling for their nature.

However, I do tend to materialism and\\ndon\\'t believe in absolute morality, so I\\'ll answer your questions.\\n\\n>How then can an atheist judge value? \\n\\nAn atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does: according\\nto a personal understanding of morality.  That I don\\'t believe in an\\nabsolute one doesn\\'t mean that I don\\'t have one.  I\\'m just explicit,\\nas in the line of postings you followed up, that when I express\\njudgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code\\nrather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad.\\nMy moral code is not particular different from that of others around\\nme, be they Christians, Muslims, or atheists.  So when I say that I\\nobject to genocide, I\\'m not expressing anything particularly out of\\nline with what my society holds.\\n\\nIf your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form it\\ndoes, my answer would be mechanistic to your taste -- that a moral\\ncode is a prerequisite for a functioning society, and that humanity\\nprobably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of\\nour ability to exist in large societies, thereby achieving\\nconsiderable survival advantages.  You\\'d probably say that God just\\nmade the rules.  Neither of us can convince the other, but we share a\\ncommon understanding about many moral issues.  You think you get it\\nfrom your religion, I think I get it (and you get it) from early\\nchildhood teaching.\\n\\n>That you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\n>or God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\n>nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\n>with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. \\n\\nI think you\\'ve been reading the wrong sort of comic books, but in\\nprying through the gobbledygook I basically agree with what you\\'re\\nsaying.  I do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as \"God\\ncommanded the genocide of the Canaanites\" is mechanistic, but of\\ncourse I think that\\'s true of you as well.  My reaction has little to\\ndo with whether God exists or even with whether I think he does, but\\nif a god existed who commanded genocide, I could not consider him\\ngood, which is supposedly an attribute of God.\\n\\n>All of this being so, you have excluded\\n>yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\\n>etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\\n>weight whatsoever.\\n\\nHmm.  Yes, I think some heavy FAQ-reading would do you some good.  I\\nhave as much place discussing values etc. as any other person.  In\\nfact, I can actually accomplish something in such a discussion, by\\nframing the questions in terms of reason: for instance, it is clear\\nthat in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt\\nto wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands, then the\\nquality of life will be generally poor, so a system that fosters\\ncoexistence is superior, if quality of life is an agreed goal.  An\\nabsolutist, on the other hand, can only thump those portions of a\\nBible they happen to agree with, and say \"this is good\", even if the\\nact in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in\\nthe discussion.  The attempt to define someone or a group of people as\\n\"excluded from discussion\", such that they \"cannot participate\", and\\ntheir opinions given \"no weight whatsoever\" is the lowest form or\\nreasoning (ad hominem/poisoning the well), and presumably the resort\\nof someone who can\\'t rationally defend their own ideas of right,\\nwrong, and the Bible.\\n-- \\nJim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC\\nThese are my opinions.

And to Holy Mary, Virgin is invariably added, for that Holy Woman\\n    remains undefiled.\\n                -- St. Epiphanus of Salamis, \"Panacea against all heresies\",\\n                   between A.D. 374-377.\\n\\n    We surely cannot deny that you were right in correcting the doctrine\\n    about children of Mary ... For the Lord Jesus would not have chosen\\n    to be born of a virgin if He had judged that she would be so incontinent\\n    as to taint the birthplace of the Body of the Lord, home of the Eternal\\n    King, with the seed of human intercourse.  Anyone who proposes this is\\n    merely proposing ... that Christ could not be born of a virgin.\\n                -- Pope St. Siricius, Letter to Anysius, Bishop of \\n                   Thessalonica, A.D. 392\\n\\nNote that St. Augustine\\'s conversion to Christianity was in A.D. 387.  I\\ndon\\'t know offhand when his election as bishop of Hippo was, but I\\'m quite\\nsure it was after 392.  The belief in Mary\\'s perpetual virginity originated\\nlong before Augustine\\'s time.  We hold that it originated with the \\nApostles.\\n\\nStrictly speaking, however, Mary\\'s perpetual virginity is independent\\nof her Immaculate Conception.  Mary could have been Immaculately \\nConceived and not remained a virgin; she could have remained a virgin\\nand not been Immaculately Conceived.\\n\\n>Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with\\n>a predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition\\n>because she did not ever sin, she didn\\'t have original sin.  When science\\n>discovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that\\n>Mary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.\\n\\nNo.  It has been held in the Church since ancient times that original\\nsin was transmitted at conception, when a person\\'s life begins.\\nBiology had nothing to do with it.  Prayerfully reflecting on the\\ntruth of Mary\\'s sinlessness, and the means by which God could have\\nachieved this, the Church arrived at the truth of the Immaculate\\nConception.  Thus, the Immaculate Conception is not a new doctrine,\\nbut the logical result of our understanding of two old ones.\\n\\nThe celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception itself was\\ngiven by Pope Sixtus IV (1471-84) and the Feast was made a precept\\nfeast of the Church by Pope Clement XI (1700-21).\\n\\n>Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She \\n>refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old \\n>would have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed\\n>to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.\\n\\nNo.  First of all, Lourdes is private revelation, and doctrine is not\\nbased on private revelation.  The most that private revelation can do\\nis enhance and deepen our understanding of existing public revelation,\\nwhich ended with the death of St. John the Apostle.\\n\\nSecond, the \"case for the doctrine\" was irreformably sealed in 1854 \\nwith the ex cathedra promulgation of the Bull \"Ineffabilis Deus\" by\\nPope Pius IX.  This meant that the doctrine was formally recognized as\\na dogma; a dogma, by definition, cannot change and is required to be\\nbelieved by the faithful.\\n\\nThe apparition at Lourdes happened in 1858, four years later.  The most\\nthat might be claimed is that Lourdes gave the infallible proclamation\\nof 1854 a sort of heavenly stamp of approval, but the Church has never\\nclaimed that, nor shall she.\\n\\nIn Christ\\'s Peace,\\n\\nBrad Kaiser\\n(bradk@isdgsm.eurpd.csg.mot.com)\\n\\n\\t  Those who trust in Him shall understand truth,\\n\\t  and the faithful shall abide with Him in love;\\n\\t  Because grace and mercy are with His holy ones,\\n\\t  and His care is with His elect.\\n\\t\\t    -- Wis 3:9 [NAB]\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

This structure is mentioned to\\ngive you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the\\njournal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views\\ninto the discourse.\\n   A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page\\nexpresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems\\nwithin the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other\\nconcerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences,\\nmind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology \\n(e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this\\npage for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get\\nsuggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express\\ntheir strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the\\narea in question.\\n   On the second page of each Number an editor\\'s profile is published.\\nThe aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional \\nachievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on\\none side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which\\neditors has lived and live on the other side.

In situation\\nright now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your\\ncolleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the\\ncontemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated.\\nA special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh\\nideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.\\n   Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.)\\nand particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome.\\nYou can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail.\\nOn the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual\\nreports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing\\nin Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.\\n   E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect.\\nYou can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete\\npapers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We received\\nseveral final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US,\\nRussia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typed\\ntexts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact\\nperson (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal.

I have had\\n>a quick look in the computer graphics literature with no results.\\n>Perhaps someone who has access to medical information could help?\\n \\nCertainly. Reference follows. \\n\\nBear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called\\nred/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major\\ndysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to long\\nwavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and\\nalso means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.\\n\\nThe other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it\\ncan also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina.\\nIt also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. \\nUnlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.\\n\\nOn a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer\\ngraphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour\\ndeficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this\\npoint. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far red\\ncorner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31\\n\\nNote that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly\\ndifferent values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental\\nsetup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.\\n\\nSo if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?\\n\\nThis problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one\\naffected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto\\nwhich all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on\\nthe spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is\\nvery similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.\\n\\n*So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or\\nduuteranopia:\\n\\n1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram\\n2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point\\n3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line\\n4) This is the new chromaticity. \\n\\nThe best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colour\\ndefective vision and computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics and\\nApplications 8(5) 28-40.\\n\\nYou will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not\\nfamiliar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.\\n\\n>I would like to write a program (probably a PPM filter) to allow\\n>previewing of images to check for sufficient contract for colour\\n>blind users. Not being colour blind myself, this is a bit difficult!\\n\\nYes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the red\\ngreen and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and\\nthe chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, or\\nobtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a\\ncouple of weeks ago.\\n\\nThe procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be a\\nhelp here.)\\n\\nA) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you\\nhave the monitor data.\\nB) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v'\\nusing u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z)\\nC) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above\\nD) find the intersection as in step 3\\nE) convert back from u'v' to XYZ, using the Y value from step A\\nF) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it\\nalong a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and\\nwhite) until it is displayable.\\n\\n>Please email replies - I will summarise and repost if there is\\n>sufficient interest\\n\\nDone; also posted for the rest of us.\\n\\n--\\nChris Lilley\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nTechnical Author, ITTI Computer Graphics and Visualisation Training Project\\nComputer Graphics Unit, Manchester Computing Centre, Oxford Road, \\nManchester, UK.

She said even common ear infections frequently seen in\\nchildren are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment.\\n\\n\"Despite predictions earlier this century that infectious  diseases\\nwould soon be eliminated as a public health problem, infectious diseases\\nremain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness\\nand death in the United States,\" the CDC said.\\n\\nIt  cited  the  emergence since the 1970s of a \"myriad\" of newly\\nidentified pathogens and syndromes, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, a\\ndeadly bacterial infection; the hepatitis C virus; HIV, the virus that\\ncauses AIDS; Legionnaires disease; Lyme disease; and toxic shock syndrome.\\n\\n\"The incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control,\\nsuch as cholera, malaria and tuberculosis, have increased in many areas,\"\\nthe CDC said.  It said efforts at control and prevention have been\\nundermined by drug resistance.\\n\\n=====*=====\\n\\nSOURCE:  WALL STREET JOURNAL\\nREFERENCE: 04/15/93, pB1\\nHEADLINE: Lyme-Disease Ruling Raises Liability Issues\\n\\nThe tick that causes Lyme disease may have found a new way to cause\\ndamage: legal liability.\\n\\nA federal judge\\'s decision holding a property owner liable for not\\ndoing enough to protect workers from Lyme disease is getting as much\\nattention as the latest medical study on the disease, a flu-like\\nillness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in\\nrare instances death. The decision last week has put property owners\\non notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from\\nthe ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if\\nsomeone becomes infected while on the property.\\n\\nThe decision by U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward in New York came\\nafter a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for the\\nLong Island Railroad. Judge Ward found that the workers contracted the\\ndisease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. He ordered\\nthe New York state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than\\n$560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering, in addition to medical\\nexpenses and lost wages.\\n\\nSummer camps, schools, companies with facilities in rural or\\nsemirural areas, and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the\\ngroups that need to be worried about this ruling, says Stephen L.\\nKass, an attorney at New York law firm Berle, Kass & Case, who wrote a\\nlegal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential\\nliability. Even a family that invites friends over for a backyard\\nbarbecue might be potentially liable.\\n\\nLawsuits for insect bites, while rare, aren\\'t unheard-of. A summer\\nvacationer in Southampton, N.Y., last year sued the owner of the home\\nshe rented, claiming that a tick on the property gave her Rocky\\nMountain spotted fever. In 1988, also on Long Island, a jury ordered\\nan outdoor restaurant to pay more than $3 million to a patron who was\\nstung by a bee, causing an allergic reaction and permanent\\nquadriplegia. The judge later threw out the award, citing no evidence\\nthat a beehive was near the restaurant.\\n\\nBut lawyers say that the attention to Lyme disease throughout the\\ncountry -- it\\'s most prevalent in New England, the Middle Atlantic\\nstates, Wisconsin, Minnesota and the Northwest -- may make this\\nparticular insect bite a particularly litigious one.\\n\\nThe illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the\\ncourtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will\\ncover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not\\ndiagnosing the disease.\\n\\nLawyers say worker\\'s-compensation claims related to Lyme disease\\nhave become common in some states in recent years. Payments in\\nworker\\'s-compensation cases, however, are limited to medical costs and\\nlost earnings.\\n\\nThe case before Judge Ward dealt with a potentially much more\\nlucrative avenue for damages, because it involved the question of\\nnegligence. Unlike the worker\\'s compensation process, the law governing\\ninjuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and, as a\\nresult, for additional payments for pain and suffering. Property\\nowners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many\\nother situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the\\ndisease.\\n\\nIra M. Maurer, a partner at New York law firm Elkind, Flynn &\\nMaurer, who represented the rail workers, says the decision will help\\nto establish \"the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect\\nagainst Lyme disease.\"\\n\\nLawyers caution that despite Judge Ward\\'s decision, winning a\\nlawsuit for damages caused by Lyme disease may prove difficult. For\\none thing, victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when\\nand where they got the tick bite. Judge Ward found that the plaintiffs\\nin the railroad case got Lyme disease while working on property owned\\nby the railroad, even though none of the men remembered being bitten.\\nThe workers, who weren\\'t outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to\\nthe insects, said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded\\nsome work sites.\\n\\nA spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that\\nthe four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is\\nconsidering an appeal. The railroad also disputes Judge Ward\\'s finding\\nthat it didn\\'t do enough to protect employees. The spokeswoman says\\nthe railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special\\npants to protect against bug bites.\\n\\nDebate in the scientific community over Lyme disease could open up\\nsome legal defenses for property owners, such as questioning whether a\\nvictim actually has the disease rather than some other illness.\\nEarlier this week, the Journal of the American Medical Association\\nreported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having Lyme disease.\\nAnd damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical\\ndisputes over the degree of harm that Lyme disease causes.\\n\\nBecause of health and safety concerns, some groups and companies\\nalready take special measures to protect against Lyme disease. Last\\nyear, at its headquarters in Franklin Lakes, N.J., Becton, Dickinson &\\nCo. began using Damminix, a pesticide made by EcoHealth Inc. of Boston\\nthat is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease. The medical-\\nsupply company\\'s headquarters include a 120-acre park, and the company\\nwas worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might\\nget infected.\\n\\nRuth Lister, a spokeswoman for the American Camping Association in\\nIndianapolis, says that many youth camps accredited by her\\norganization also have begun to check children for ticks. And Carole\\nKatz, a member of the board of the Fire Island Pines Property Owners\\nAssociation, says her group spends $30,000 each year to treat their\\n100-acre site off the coast of New York with the tick-killing\\npesticide.\\n\\n=====*=====\\n\\nTITLE: Urinary dysfunction in Lyme disease.\\nAUTHORS: Chancellor MB; McGinnis DE; Shenot PJ; Kiilholma P; Hirsch IH,\\nDepartment of Urology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson\\nUniversity, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\\nREFERENCE: J Urol 1993 Jan; 149 (1): 26-30\\n\\nLyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is\\nassociated with a variety of neurological sequelae.  We describe 7 patients\\nwith neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction.\\nUrodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients and\\ndetrusor areflexia in 2.  Detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not\\nnoted on electromyography in any patient.  We observed that the urinary tract\\nmay be involved in 2 respects in the course of Lyme  disease: 1) voiding\\ndysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2) the spirochete may\\ndirectly invade the urinary tract.  In 1 patient bladder infection by the\\nLyme spirochete was documented on biopsy.  Neurological and urological\\nsymptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was\\nprotracted.  Relapses of active Lyme disease and residual neurological\\ndeficits were common.  Urologists practicing in areas endemic for Lyme\\ndisease need to be aware of B. burgdorferi infection in the differential\\ndiagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.  Conservative bladder\\nmanagement including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic\\nevaluation is recommended.\\n\\n\\nIV. ***** QUESTIONS \\'N\\' ANSWERS *****\\n\\nNote: If you have a response to this question, please forward it to the\\neditor.\\n\\nSender: Terry Morse <morset@ccmail.orst.edu>\\nSubject: Question on Lyme Vectors and Compost Piles\\n\\n  When I visited my sister on Long Island, NY, I was cautioned to avoid the\\ncompost heap in her back yard, as she thinks this is where she became\\ninfected.\\n\\n  A friend of mine here in Oregon who has a compost heap would like me to\\nback that claim up with documentation.

If \\none denies the existence of spiritual things, one would presumably call \\nthese \"emotional needs\". The reason Christians call them spiritual needs \\nis that they have aspects that are not fulfillable except by spiritual \\nmeans--ie a person could be loved and accepted by many people, and do \\nmany meaningful things, but still have a need for love, which can only be\\nsatisfied by the love of God.  Now the problem is that there are people who\\naccept the existence of these needs, and people who reject them.  Since I\\nbelieve in absolute truth, some of these people are right, and the others\\nare wrong.  So here are the 2 possibilities:\\n\\n1) If Christians are right, then we all have spiritual needs--ie\\nwe all need God.  Those who do not realize that they need God are \\ndeluded--they just haven\\'t recognized it yet.\\n\\n2) If Christians are wrong, spiritual needs are an artefact of our brain\\nchemicals.  Well-adjusted and properly-integrated personalities do not\\nhave such things.  Christians are simply using the concept of God and \\nspiritual needs to mask their own inadequacies.\\n\\nI hate to belabour the point, but the existence of spirits and spiritual\\nneeds cannot be objectively demonstrated or proven, just like the existence\\nof God cannot.  And yes, this means that there is a risk that all my subjective\\nevidence is manufactured by my brain chemicals.  But on the other hand, I \\ncould venture into solipsism and say that there is a risk that everything that\\nI appear to objectively know is really manufactured by my brain chemicals.\\n\\nI suspect this is an unsatisfactory answer to a request for evidence and\\ndemonstration of the existence of spirits and spiritual needs, but my assertion\\nis that such things are not objectively demonstrable.

All the clamor \\nover laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical \\ntrials which proved(to me anyway) that laetril was ineffective against \\ncancer.  A physician who continued to use it, when better, more effective, \\ntreatments are available, may deserve to be called a quack.  Anti-fungals \\nare in a different class.  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to \\nuse them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be due \\nto candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics?  Gorden \\nRubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognize \\nthe chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use \\nand they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to \\nrestore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this is \\nyet a standard part of medical practice.  He deals with critical care \\npatients where fungal infection(systemic) is a real problem and just \\nbecause he tries to keep *good* bacteria in his patients does not mean that \\nall physicians do this.  I think that aspergillis is more likely to be \\nfound in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida.

Since candida \\ncolonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area, GI symptoms should be more common \\nthan vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use.\\n\\nThe problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by \\na candida bloom.  The arguement is that without proof, no action is \\nwarrented.\\n\\nMedicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way.  There \\nhas always been the use of conventional wisdom.  A very good example is \\nkidney stones.  Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been \\ndone to come up with an effective prevention), was that restricitng the \\nintake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones \\nfrom forming.  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to \\nbreakdown the stone once it formed.  Through the recent New England J of \\nMedicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong, \\nincreasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is \\nrestricting calcium intake.\\n\\nThe conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to \\nbe reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy.\\nIf it makes sense for livestock, why doesn\\'t it make sense for humans \\nDavid?  We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider \\nyogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice, as \\nGordon R. says it is, then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast \\ninfections should decline.\\n\\nMarty B.\\n' ------------> sci.med\n",

Basically, what I think \\nI\\'ve observed is that the phrase \"the Ten Commandments\", \\nas used by Moses, is not a reference to Ex. 20:1-17, but \\nrather a reference to ten distinct discourses from Ex. \\n20:1 through Ex. 31:18.  That is, the phrase \"the Ten \\nCommandments\" should more accurately be translated \"the \\nTen Discourses\", of which the passage we call the \"Ten \\nCommandments\" is really only the first.\\n\\nI\\'m not completely convinced that the above is true, but \\nfor purposes of discussion, let me argue it as though I \\nwas sure.\\n\\nArguments supporting the above idea:\\n\\n1)  There aren\\'t really ten commandments in Ex. 20:1-17.  \\nIn order to get 10 commandments, you have to get two of \\nthem out of verses 3-6, and the verses themselves do not \\nsupport such a division because they are all about not \\nworshipping other gods.  That is, verse 3 commands to \\nhave no other gods, and verse 5 commands to not worship \\nthe idols mentioned in verse 4.  You can\\'t violate \\nverses 5-6 without violating verse 3, indicating that \\nthe whole passage is one command, and leaving us with \\nonly Nine \"Commandments\".  I could go on at length about \\nthis, but for now I\\'ll just stop with this summary.\\n\\n2)  There ARE ten speeches between Ex 20:1 (the beginning\\nof the traditional \"Ten Commandments\") and Ex 31:18 \\n(where God actually gives Moses the two tablets with the \\nTen Commandments/Discourses written on them).  I break \\nthese ten down as follows: 20:1-17; 20:22-26; 21:1-23:33; \\n25:1-30:10; 30:11-16; 30:17-21; 30:22-33; 30:34-38; \\n31:1-11; and 31:12-18.  In most cases, each of these \\npassages begins with some variation of the phrase, \"And \\nthe LORD spoke to Moses, saying...\"  The exception is \\nEx. 21:1, which begins \"Now these are the ordinances \\nwhich you are to set before them...\"\\n\\n3)  The word translated \"commandments\" in the phrase \\n\"the Ten Commandments\" isn\\'t really the word for \\n\"commandment\", its the word for a speech, or an \\nutterance.  It\\'s a word often used for longer discourses \\nrather than individual statements; for instance, when \\ncombined with the word \\'yom\\' (day), this word is \\ntranslated \"Chronicles\" in such phrases as \"now the rest \\nof the acts of so-and-so, are they not written in the \\nChronicles of x?...\"  The word for \"commandment\" is \\nfreely used throughout the books of Moses, and perhaps \\nit is significant that when Moses spoke of the Ten X\\'s, \\nhe appears to have avoided the word for commandment and \\nchosen instead a word associated with discourses longer \\nthan just a single command.\\n\\n4)  God tells Moses that He is going to give him the \\nstone tablets \"with the law and the commandments\" (Ex \\n24:12), yet He does not give Moses the tablets until He \\nhas finished all ten discourses on Mount Sinai.  If the \\nTen Commandments were only Ex. 20:1-17, it is not \\nimmediately clear why God would wait several days and \\nnine more discourses before giving these tablets to \\nMoses.  On the other hand, if we have the Ten Discourses \\nwritten on the tablets, then it makes perfect sense that \\nGod would not give Moses the tablets until He had \\nfinished delivering all Ten Discourses.\\n\\n5)  When Moses did get the tablets, he found that both \\ntablets were written on both sides (Ex. 32:15).  If \\nthese Ten \"Commandments\" were only the first 17 verses \\nof Ex. 20, God would have had to have written in LARGE \\nletters!  Not that He couldn\\'t have, of course, but it \\ndoes seem more likely to me that this is a reference to \\ntwo tablets containing ten discourses written in normal-\\nsized letters.\\n\\n6)  In II Cor. 3, Paul seems to specifically single out \\nthe \"commandments written on stone\" as being the \\n\"ministry of death\", \"that which is fading away,\" and \\n\"the ministry of condemnation.\"  With the possible \\nexception of the commandment about the Sabbath, it is \\ndifficult to see why Paul would refer to the commands in \\nEx. 20:1-17 as being temporary, \"fading away\"-type \\ncommandments.  This is less of a problem if the stone \\ntablets should happen to have included all of the \\ncommandments from Ex 20 through Ex 31.\\n\\nArguments against this idea:\\n\\nThe main argument against this idea, aside from the fact \\nthat it contradicts a long-standing tradition, is that \\nin Dt 5:22, Moses says, after quoting the commands in \\nEx. 20:1-17, \"These words the LORD spoke...and He added \\nno more.  And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and \\ngave them to me.\"  This appears to identify the words \\njust quoted as being the only contents of the two stone \\ntablets.\\n\\nThat was my first impression, anyway.  However, after \\nsome thought, I noted that a great deal hinges on how \\nyou understand the phrase \"These words.\"  If Moses meant \\n\"These words *which I have just related to you* were \\nspoken by God\" etc., then that would mean that only the \\ntraditional \"Ten Commandments\" were on the stone \\ntablets.  If, however, Moses was making a parenthetical \\ncomment--\"These words *which I AM NOW telling you* were \\nspoken by God\" etc.--then that\\'s quite different.\\n\\nI did note that in the Dt 5 account, Moses tells of \\nbeing given the stone tablets BEFORE telling of the \\npeople asking Moses to represent them before God, \\nwhereas in the Exodus account, the people asked this of \\nMoses between the first and second discourses, several \\ndays BEFORE God gave Moses the stone tablets.  This \\nreinforces the idea that Moses\\' remarks in Dt 5:22ff \\nwere intended as a parenthetical remark, rather than a \\nstrictly chronological account of when God wrote what, \\nand at what point He stopped adding to what was on the \\ntablets.\\n\\nSummary:  all things considered, I find it somewhat more \\nlikely that the nine commands in Ex 20 are really only \\nthe first of what Moses regarded as the Ten Discourses \\nof God.

You should\\n generally *not* take rutin by itself, but take the whole bioflavonoid \\n complex instead. If you don\\'t (and there are some exceptions to that)\\n you\\'ll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency, which is the other\\n major component of the bioflavonoid complex.\\n I found out the hard way years ago when I recommended rutin, after it\\n showed deficient in patients who were NOT deficient in hesperidin be-\\n fore. A later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in \\n hesperidin, which, from then on, made me always *add* bioflavonoids \\n to anyone that had *very* low levels of rutin.\\n Most of the time people are equally low in rutin *and* hesperidin, so\\n there is really no reason to take rutin by itself, but use the whole\\n bioflavonoid complex instead.\\n\\n I have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that \\n they had been helped with hemorrhoids, varicose veins, chronic nose \\n bleeds, aneurysms, gastro-intestinal bleeding (due to drugs), etc...\\n One patient in desperation took a whole bottle (100\\'s) in one day\\n for his painful, bleeding hemorrhoids, without any ill effects.\\n  \\n They are also non-toxic in very high amounts, that\\'s why they can\\n be safely recommended. If you are allergic to citrus fruit (they are\\n made from their peels), pine bark sources are available as well.\\n\\n About 90% of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency, \\n with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 - 2,000mg.\\n For major complaints, 4 - 6,000mg+/day is common.\\n \\n In case they cannot be taken, because of their size and taste (they\\n are big, and they don\\'t taste that great), a product made from pine \\n bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite\\n small and taste much better, however the cost is about seven times\\n higher for the equivalent effect. One 25mg tablet of the pine bark\\n extract gives you about the same effect as 1,000mg of bioflavonoids.\\n The name for the pine bark product is \\'Pycnogenol.\\'\\n  \\n   Some Canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are:\\n \\n   Quest.............1,000mg   big, bitter, not chewable\\n   Swiss Herbal........600mg   smooth, easier swallowing \\n   Jamieson............500mg   medium, bitter, chewable \\n\\n   SISU.................25mg   (Pycnogenol) small, easy swallowing\\n \\n   Give them a try and see what happens.....and good luck!\\n\\n   -- Ron Roth --\\n =====================================================================\\n --  Internet: rn.3228@rose.com  -  Rosenet: ron roth@rosehamilton  --\\n\\n *   \"Eating Radium has strange results,\"  Tom said brightly.\\n---\\n   RoseReader 2.10  P003228 Entered at [ROSEHAMILTON]\\n   RoseMail 2.10 : Usenet: Rose Media - Hamilton (416) 575-5363\\n' ------------> sci.med\n",

I tell you\\nthe truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God\\nlike a little child will never enter it.\"\\n\\nThe Colossians passage does not make faith a requirement\\nfor baptism.  It merely says that in baptism we are born again,\\nregenerated, and resurrected through faith.  In the case\\nof an infant I would say that baptism works faith in the\\nheart of the infant--through the power of the word.\\n\\nThe Colossians passage does make baptism a spiritual circumcision.\\nCircumcision was the means by which a male infant was made\\na part of God\\'s covenant with Israel.  It was commanded to be\\nperformed on the eighth day.  The early church understood this,\\nand even debated whether baptism had to be performed on the\\neighth day, or if it could in fact be done earlier.\\n\\nAaron> Romans 10:16-17 \"But not all the Israelites accepted the good\\nAaron> news.  For Isaiah says, \\'Lord, who has believed our message?\\'\\nAaron> Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the\\nAaron> message is heard through the word of Christ.\"\\n\\nAaron> So then we receive God\\'s gift of faith to us as we hear the\\nAaron> message of the gospel.  \\n\\nAnd the gospel is surely preached at any infant\\'s (or adult\\'s)\\nbaptism.

I don\\'t\\nknow.  But original sin does not consist of God\\'s imputation\\nof Adam\\'s guilt to us.  It consists of our inheritance of\\nAdam\\'s sinful nature.  It is actual sin.

OK, we all have off days - perhaps you should step back and think this one\\nthrough.\\n\\n>>Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?\\n\\n>It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not\\n>designed for that.\\n\\nAs I said in the last post, JPEG is a compression algorithm.

You are the *only* person I have met or spoken to who,\\nhaving quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehow\\nreverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made\\nto the 8 bit image palette.\\n\\nPerhaps that is why you yused the singular?\\n\\n>say,\\n>person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is\\n>expected that the image still is the same. \\n\\nLook, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main\\ncontrol panel - it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit\\nimage. XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit\\nfile. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.\\n\\n>So, XV were designed\\n>without thinking about human interface and how human expect the\\n>program work -- design error.\\n\\nIs a design error the same as a bug? ;-)\\n\\nRead my lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. It lets\\nyou import other images. It shows, I would say, a good deal of thought about the\\nhuman interface. And everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it\\nwas designed for. It makes no false claims.\\n\\n>I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but\\n>it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making\\n>major change to the original design.\\n\\nIf you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of\\nprecisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them. So \\nfar, you have not done so.\\n\\n>So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved\\n>images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.\\n\\nArgh!! After all this, a comment like that. `Very easily'. OK, go ahead and code it\\nif it is so easy.\\n\\nOr alternatively, look up the terms `import' and 'non-reversible transformation'.\\n\\n>Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where\\n>'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes\\n>up, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however,\\n>even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem.\\n>(Americans: the lift is just an example :)\\n\\nI think this is a bit of an exageration.\\n\\nWhat you are actually saying is, you got into a lift (elevator, if you are in\\nthe states ;-) ) and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up.

Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he\\nremained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:\\n\\n\"Galactic Pot-Healer\"\\nA fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a\\nremote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.

The book is the diary of a woman\\'s life as she tries to live\\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women\\'s right to own property is revoked,\\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood\\'s writing style is difficult to get used to\\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\\n\\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\\n\\n\"The Bible\"\\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.

In this\\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\\ndecisively rejected in Mackie\\'s \"The Miracle of Theism\".

It also addresses those\\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\\nGod\" such as Lelie\\'s axiarchism.

For one, your claim that everyone senses it\\n#is not founded, and you have been asked to give evidence for it often.\\n#And then, the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it\\n#is there unless evidence against it has been found.\\n\\nI have no problem with the second statement.  I have provided an\\nargument that almost everyone senses that Freedom is valuable - the\\nonly cogent objection to this came from jon livesey, and was offered\\nby some other people too: essentially, that people disagree about\\nfuzzy concepts such as Freedom.  It\\'s a good point, and I\\'m thinking\\nabout it.\\n# \\n#Your trick is to say, I feel A is not right, and so do many I know,\\n#therefore A is absolutely right. It neglects the possibility that\\n#these people consider A to be right as an effect of the same process,\\n#restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject\\n#of that process. In other words, refutes it. You make the ontological\\n#claim, you have to prove it.\\n\\nNonsense.  My \"trick\" is to say:  I feel that A is better than B and so \\ndoes almost any disinterested person I ask.  Best evidence is therefore \\nthat A really is better than B, subject to the assumption that we\\ncan establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by A and B, and\\nthat the resulting system of values is self-consistent.\\n\\nNow get this:  \"really is better\" is an idealisation, a fictional model,\\nin the same sense that \"real material existence\" is a fictional model. It\\nmay or may not correspond to something true.  It is nonetheless a useful\\n_assumption_.  Far more useful than the equally assumed relativist \\n\"trick\", to wit:\\n\\nI feel that A is better than B, and so does almost any disinterested person\\nI ask.  However, if even one person disagrees that A is better than B,\\nor if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of A and B,\\nthen it is the case that B is better than A for that person, and nothing\\nmore can be said.  \\n\\nI say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority\\nseeking to maximise A cannot morally take action against someone seeking to\\nmaximise B (e.g. a terrorist).  To do that would be to claim that \\na supermajority\\'s carefully considered morality would be better than the \\nterrorist\\'s - which would, of course, be true, but a no-no for an ethical\\nrelativist.  To claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is\\nsimply weasel words, and an example of compartmentalisation to rival\\nanything in the world of religion.\\n\\n#>#For a similar argument, I sense morality is subjective, it does not\\n#>#hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by\\n#>#others.\\n#>\\n#>If you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively\\n#>wrong, and it turns out not to be the case for you - of course this\\n#>is possible.  It is neither evidence for subjectivism, nor evidence\\n#>against objectivism (except sometimes, in a pragmatic sense).\\n#>\\n#It serves as a counterexample for that everything that is subject to\\n#judgements is absolute. And as long as you don\\'t provide evidence for\\n#that there is something universally agreed upon there is no reason to\\n#believe your hypothesis.\\n\\nI\\'ve done this: freedom, with the proviso that I still have to \\nanswer jon\\'s objection that fuzzy concepts like freedom have no\\nobjective meaning.\\n\\n#Further, in order to make morality absolute, universal, or objective,\\n#you would have to show that it is independent of humans, or the attributes\\n#above look quite misleading.\\n\\nNot really.  What evidence is there that _anything_ exists independently\\nof humans?  You\\'ll be hard pressed to find any that isn\\'t logically\\nequivalent when applied to values.\\n\\n#>An analogous set of premises would be:\\n#>\\n#>Premise 1:  Some people believe that objectively speaking the shortest\\n#>            route  from my house to a bar is through the main entrance\\n#>            of the estate, and down the Malahide road.\\n#>\\n#>Premise 2:  I checked it out, and found that the shortest route from my\\n#>            which is much closer.\\n#>\\n#>You would never deduce from these that there is no shortest route from my\\n#>house to a bar; yet that is seemingly how you derive your relativist claim,\\n#>using premises which are logically no different.\\n#>\\n# \\n#No. Morals are a matter of belief so far. The people still believe that the\\n#shortest way is through the main entrance. No agreement on *belief* here.\\n#And in order to have an analogy you would have to show that there is a\\n#shortest way and that there is a method to convince everyone of that it\\n#is the shortest way indeed. In other words,  your analogy works only when\\n#one assumes that your  premises are right in the first place. If not, it is\\n#a fallacy.\\n\\nAnd if this were an argument for objectivism, you\\'d be right.  It isn\\'t,\\nthough, it\\'s a demonstration that the argument you gave me is neither argument\\n*against* objectivism, nor argument *for* relativism.

Rudolf Frieling elaborates this in detail in his \\n\"Christianity and Reincarnation\".  The thrust of the passage\\nin its context is to liken the one time incarnation and \\nsacrifice of Christ for all mankind to the individual \\nexperience of the human being after death.  The \"once\" \\nis repeated and emphasized, and it highlights the singularity \\nof Christ\\'s deed.  One thing for certain it does is to \\nrefute the claims of some that Christ incarnates more than \\nonce.  But the comparison to the human experience - die \\nonce, then judgement (note: not \"the judgement\", but just \\n\"judgement\".  The word for judgement is \"krisis\".\\n\\nHebrews 9:27 is the one passage most often quoted in defense\\nof the doctrine that the Bible denies reincarnation.  At this\\npoint, I would just emphasize again that the  passages \\nthat (arguably) speak against it are few, and that invariably\\nthey are talking about something eles, and the apparent denial\\nof reincarnation is either inferred, or, as in the case of\\nHebrews, taken literally and deposited into an implied context,\\nnamely a doctrine of the destiny of the human being after\\ndeath.\\n\\nWhat should be considered seriously is that the Bible is essentially\\nsilent about the fate of the individual human being between death\\nand the Last Day.  If you take the few passages that could possibly\\nbe interpreted to mean a single earth life, they are arguable.  And\\nthere are other passages that point, arguably, in the other direc-\\ntion. such as Matthew 11:14 and John 9:2.\\n\\nWe can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture that\\nmight have a bearinig on this, and indeed we should discuss them.\\nBut what I wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approach\\nto the idea of repeated earth lives that, unlike Hindu, Buddhist\\nand \"new age\" teachings, takes full cognizance of the divinity, singular\\nincarnation, death, burial, resurrection, and second coming of Christ\\nas the savior of mankind; the accountability of each individual for\\nhis deeds and the reality of the Fall and of sin and its consequences;\\nthe redemption of man from sin through Christ; the resurrection of\\nthe body, and the Last Judgement.\\n\\nTaken in this larger sense, many serious questions take on an entirely\\ndifferent perspective.  E.g. the destiny of those who died in their\\nsins before Christ came. the relationship of faith and grace to \\nworks, the meaning of \"deathbed conversion\", the meaning of the\\nsacraments, and many other things.  Not that I propose to answer all\\nthose questions by a simple doctrine of convenience, but only that\\nthe discussion takes on a different dimension, and in my opinion\\none that is truly worthy of both man, the earth, and their Creator and \\nRedeemer. There are many deep questions that continue to be deep, such \\nas the meaning of the second death, and how the whole of Christian\\ndoctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence.\\n\\nThere are those who deeply believe that the things of which the Bible \\ndoes not speak are not things we should be concerned with.  But Christ\\nalso indicated that there were other things that we would come to know\\nin the future, including things that his disciples (and therefore others) \\ncould not bear yet.  This idea that the human capacity for growth in\\nknowledge, not only of the individual in one lifetime, but of the whole\\nof humanity, also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growth\\nin the spirit is a long term process.  The Bible was not meant to codify\\nall spiritual knowledge in one place forever, but to proclaim the gospel\\nof the incarnation and redeeming deed of Christ - taking the gospel in the\\ngreater context, from Genesis to Revelation.  Now, salvation (healing) becomes, \\nnot the end of man\\'s sojourn but its beginning.

A\\nlower court had banned the local Gideons, an international Bible-\\ndistribution group, from passing out Bibles to fifth-graders. The\\nACLU\\'s Barry Lynn was quoted as saying that the court\\'s action\\nprotected the \"religious neutrality of our public schools.\" He also\\nsaid that schools must serve students of \"all faiths and none.\"\\nSchools were not to be a \"bazaar where rival religious groups\\ncompete for converts,\" according to Lynn.\\n\\nSeveral Gideons, men who are responsible for putting Bibles in\\nhospitals and hotels, are members of our church. They tell of\\nsimilar stories where they are only allowed to distribute Bibles on\\nsidewalks around the schools, but cannot go inside the schools.\\nThey tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their\\nchildren receiving a Bible from a stranger. They are willing to\\ncontinue their work at a distance, but find the school\\'s position\\nsomewhat disheartening.\\n\\nI understand rationally and logically the court\\'s position. And, I\\ncan see the sense of fairness for all groups. But, on the other\\nhand, when does \"neutrality\" become \"nihilism?\" When does plurality\\nturn into no position at all?\\n\\nI see a couple of ironies here. One is that we can pass out condoms\\nbut not Bibles in our schools. Think on that one for a moment.\\n\\nThe other is that while we are seeking \"religious neutrality\" in\\nour schools, countries like Russia--who, by the way, practiced\\n\"religious neutrality\" for the past seventy years--are making the \\nBible part of their public school curriculum. When I was in St.\\nPetersburg in March, the church we worked with had trained over 100\\npublic school teachers to teach the Bible, and the government had\\nrequested hundreds more! I recently heard a medical doctor who is\\npresident of the Gideon chapter in Moscow tell how they are eagerly\\ninvited to the University of Moscow to distribute Bibles to the\\nstudents and are given class time to explain its contents. I\\nremember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a Bible and\\nspeaking to the university students standing under a statue of\\nLenin. Now, that\\'s ironic!\\n\\nI admit two things: 1) We are a pluralistic society, and all faiths\\nhave equal footing. This is what our country was founded on. 2) To\\nallow every group on school grounds could create a bazaar-like\\natmosphere. Each city must work to be inclusive of all religions\\nand provide a hearing for them. 3)--I know I said two--The vitality\\nof religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the public\\narena acknowledges it as valid.\\n\\nHowever--and you knew this was coming--I believe, disallowing the\\ndistribution of the Bible by law-abiding, caring adults in our\\nschools only signals once again our culture\\'s movement away from a\\nsingular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can make\\nmoral and ethical decisions.\\n\\nWhat do you think? \\n\\n                         -= MAIL BOX =-\\n(Let me know if you do not want me to print your letter or your\\nname.)\\n\\nGood column [re: TIME coverstory about teen sexuality]; I agree\\nwith moral education from home, but some homes don\\'t have the kinds\\nof morals I want taught.

Others work only at specific times during the cell cycle.\\n\\nThe first phase of the cell cycle is G1; it is when the protein synthesis\\nand RNA systhesis occurs.  In the second phase, S, synthesis of DNA occurs.\\nThe third phase is G2; The DNA splits and RNA and protein are synthesized \\naagain.  In the fourth phase, M (or Mitosis), the cell may divide.\\n\\nThere are drugs which are effective in each phase.  Some stop DNA synthesis.\\nOthers stop the cell from dividing. Others wreck protein synthesis.\\nAt any rate, the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cells\\nto stop growing.\\n\\nIf what you are seeking is \"practical\" advice, I apologize for rambling\\non the techno stuff.  Some side effects are pretty common.  Chemo. drugs\\nare rather nasty.  It can cause a person to lose their appetite and to \\nexperience nausea and vomiting.  Things to help this include eating small\\nfrequent meals.  It is also suggested that if nausea/vomiting (hereafter\\nknown as n/v) occurs that the person notify the doctor; there are medicines\\ntthat help nausea.  Diarrhea can be an effect.  Antidiarrheal medications \\ncan be given, and good skincare and fluid intake are important.\\n\\nProbably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss.  This does not always\\nhappen.  It depends on what drugs are being given, and on the person \\nthemself.  Different people taking the same drug can and do have different\\nside effects.  I have seen some literature which states that wearing a snug\\nheadband and/or wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss, presumably\\nby reducing blood flow to the scalp.

But \\nit is interesting that his threefold denial -- to the question whether \\nhe is the Christ, the Prophet (i.e. Isaiah), or Elijah, is emphatic in \\nthe first case and very weak in the third.\\n\\nI would like to add once again that, while it is important to discuss the\\ndifferent passages that may point directly to the teaching of repeated\\nearth lives, one way or another, what I really see as important in our\\ntime is that the subject be revisited in terms of the larger view of\\nChristianity and Christian doctrine.  For the most part, those who do\\naccept it either reject the central ideas of Christianity or, if they\\nare Christians, hold their conviction as a kind of separate treasure.\\nI believe that Christianity has important new understanding to bring\\nto bear on it, and vice versa, much that is central to Christianity\\ntakes on entirely new dimensions of meaning in light of repeated earth\\nlives. It has a direct bearing on many of the issues frequently discussed \\nin this newsgroup in particular.\\n\\nI have said openly that I have developed my views of repeated earth lives\\nlargely from the work of Rudolf Steiner.  Not that I hold him as an\\nauthority, but the whole picture of Christianity becomes clearer in light\\nof these ideas.  Steiner indicated that the old consciousness of reincar-\\nnation necessarily had to fade away that it could be renewed in later\\ntimes, after a time of development of the Christ idea through the first\\ntwo millenia after Christ\\'s deed on Golgotha.  In our own time, it becomes \\nimportant that, having received the basic gospel of salvation, our \\nunderstanding of life and of the human being can now grow to embrace the \\nsignificance of this idea.  For the discussions in this newsgroup, I \\nhave tried to focus on that which can be related as directly as possible \\nto scripture and to fundamental Christian teaching and tradition.\\n\\nGerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)\\n' ------------> soc.religion.christian\n",

The drastic change of environment\\nwill often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home. Even\\nyoung people find the change unsettling.\\n\\nThough we have thought that this decrement in function after - say -\\nanaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip (a common event in the\\nelderly) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the\\nchange of situation is much more important. Some hospitals have\\ntried a 'rapid transit' system for hip fractures, aiming to have the\\npatient back at home within 24 hours of admission. The selection of\\nthe anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge these\\npatients early.\\n\\nAnaesthetists who work with the elderly (which is almost all of us)\\ngenerally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used to\\nthe individual patient. Even so, there is some evidence that full\\nmental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return. This is\\nthe sort of thing which is detected by setting quite difficult\\ntasks, not the gross change that the original poster noted.\\n\\nHaloperidol (Haldol TM) is a long acting drug. The plasma half life\\nof the drug is up to 35 hours. If the decanoate (a sort of slow\\nrelease formulation) is used it may be weeks. The elderly are\\nsensitive to haloperidol for a number of reasons.
